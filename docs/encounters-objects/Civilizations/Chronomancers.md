# Chronomancers

**Type:** Precursor Civilization (Epoch 4 - Temporal Age)
**Alias:** Temporal Weavers

## Description
The most enigmatic and perhaps most recently vanished Precursor civilization. Their defining characteristic was mastery over time itself. Their origins are unclear â€“ were they a distinct species, a faction evolved from the [[Star-Weavers]], or something stranger entirely?

## Characteristics & Technology
*   Ability to manipulate time: travel, loops, localized dilation/compression.
*   Existence often inferred from paradoxes, temporal anomalies, and artifacts unstuck from the normal flow of time.
*   May have utilized unstable temporal portals or rifts for movement or other purposes.
*   Their motives are completely inscrutable from a Khemri perspective.
*   Technology might involve artifacts that phase in/out of existence, show causal loops, or store temporal echoes ([[Chrono-Resin Fragment]]?).

## Remnants
*   Locations caught in repeating time loops.
*   Areas where past or future events bleed into the present (temporal echoes, ghosts?).
*   Artifacts exhibiting temporal instability ([[Temporal Fruit Samples]], [[Phasing Geometric Seeds]]).
*   Unstable temporal portals or rifts.
*   Individuals, creatures, or even environments displaced from their original time.

## History & Consequences
*   Potentially responsible for the [[Year of Skyfall]] event and the disappearance of the [[Star-Weavers]], possibly through temporal warfare, a large-scale experiment gone wrong, or attempts to avert a different catastrophe.
*   Their actions may have fragmented recorded history, making accurate timelines impossible.
*   Their remaining artifacts and temporal anomalies represent extreme and unpredictable hazards.

## Mysteries
*   What was their ultimate goal in manipulating time?
*   Where did they originate, and where did they go?
*   Did they intentionally cause the Year of Skyfall, or was it an accident?
*   Can their temporal portals be stabilized or controlled?
*   What paradoxes have their actions already embedded in the world's history?
*   Is the [[Dust Fever]] plague related to a Chronomancer temporal effect or bio-weapon?

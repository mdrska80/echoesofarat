# Elder Ones

**Type:** Precursor Civilization (Epoch 1 - Primordial Age)
**Alias:** Deep Dwellers

## Description
The oldest known intelligence to inhabit this world, dating back to a primordial epoch before recorded time or even coherent legend. Their nature is profoundly alien, possibly non-biological or existing partially outside Khemri-perceived dimensions.

## Characteristics & Technology
*   Associated with shaping the deep earth and fundamental forces rather than conventional technology.
*   Constructed using cyclopean masonry of impossible scale and fused-black stone.
*   Architecture often incorporates non-Euclidean geometry that defies Khemri understanding and can induce vertigo or madness.
*   Created deep, extensive tunnel networks that may warp space or connect distant locations unnaturally.
*   Artifacts are often made of cool, obsidian-like materials, exhibiting impossible geometry and sometimes emitting strange vibrations or psychic residue.
*   Their motives and ultimate fate are completely unknown.

## Remnants
*   Deep, geometrically unnatural tunnels and subterranean complexes.
*   Foundations of cyclopean structures, often buried beneath later ruins (e.g., potentially under [[Dustfall Outpost]]).
*   Mind-bending artifacts ([[Elder Sign Geode]]) that can be hazardous to observe or handle.
*   Areas where reality feels thin, strangely angled, or psychically charged.
*   Fused-black stone construction elements.

## History & Consequences
*   Their civilization predates all others known.
*   Their deep structures may form the bedrock beneath subsequent ruins.
*   Their lingering influence might manifest as spatial anomalies, psychic disturbances, or hazards within deep tunnels.
*   Their departure, decline, or transition is unrecorded.

## Mysteries
*   What was their true nature (biological, energy, dimensional)?
*   Where did they go, or did they simply change beyond recognition?
*   What powers did they truly wield?
*   What lies at the deepest points of their tunnel networks?
*   Do any Elder Ones, or entities associated with them, still linger in the depths?

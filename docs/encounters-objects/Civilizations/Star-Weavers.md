# Star-Weavers

**Type:** Precursor Civilization (Epoch 3 - Stellar Age)
**Alias:** Sky-Sailors

## Description
The most technologically advanced and recognizable Precursor civilization according to [[The Khemri Civilization|Khemri]] legends, though still shrouded in myth. They are believed to have been interstellar travelers who arrived from, and eventually departed into, the 'silver void' between worlds.

## Characteristics & Technology
*   Mastery of interstellar travel ('sailing the silver void').
*   Advanced metallurgy, creating unique alloys like [[Star-Metal]].
*   Potent energy generation (sources sometimes mistaken for 'eternal flames').
*   Sophisticated computation, potentially including AI.
*   Stable portal technology for transit between locations or possibly worlds.
*   Advanced preservation techniques using unique materials like [[Star-Resin]].
*   Introduced non-native flora/fauna ([[Star-Weaver Fruit Cache]], [[Geometric Seeds]]?).
*   Aesthetics often described as smooth, elegant, sometimes blending organic curves with high technology.
*   Their written language/data storage methods may be decipherable with extreme effort.

## Remnants
*   Crashed or hidden void-ships.
*   Underground bases or laboratories, often still powered ([[lore.md#Mysteries & Legends]]).
*   Artifacts made of [[Star-Metal]] ([[Resonating Sun Amulet]]).
*   Stable (though often inactive) portal frames.
*   Data crystals or archives.
*   Advanced tools, devices, and materials ([[Star-Resin Fragment]]).
*   Descendants of introduced flora/fauna.

## History & Consequences
*   Their arrival likely coincided with the decline of the [[Serpent Sovereigns]].
*   Their departure or disappearance is associated with the [[Year of Skyfall]] event, a poorly understood catastrophe possibly linked to the [[Chronomancers]].
*   Their leftover technology (bases, portals, artifacts) represents both immense opportunity and danger for the Khemri.
*   Khemri civilization sometimes repurposed Star-Weaver materials ([[Stele of the Skyfall Harvest]] mentions 'Sky-Metal' beams).

## Mysteries
*   What did they look like?
*   What was the true nature of the 'silver void'?
*   Where did they come from, and where did they go?
*   What exactly happened during the [[Year of Skyfall]]?
*   Can their portals be reactivated, and are they safe?
*   Do any automated systems or AI survive in their hidden bases?

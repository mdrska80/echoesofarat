# Serpent Sovereigns

**Type:** Precursor Civilization (Epoch 2 - Abyssal Age)
**Alias:** Abyssal Architects

## Description
An advanced, possibly non-human (reptilian? amphibian?) civilization that dominated the planet's oceans and waterways before expanding onto land during their epoch.

## Characteristics & Technology
*   Masters of hydro-technology and potentially large-scale water manipulation (ancient canals?).
*   Possessed potent bio-engineering capabilities, possibly creating strange beasts or altering existing fauna.
*   Legends hint they may have worshipped or communed with vast, abyssal entities.
*   Their glyphs often feature serpent or wave motifs.

## Remnants
*   Submerged ruins (domes, towers, cities?) in the [[Great River Arat]] or coastal depths.
*   Strange biological specimens preserved in fluids.
*   Vast, ancient canal systems predating [[The Khemri Civilization|Khemri]] work.
*   Biological artifacts or genetically engineered creatures.

## History & Consequences
*   Their rise may have coincided with or followed the decline of the [[Elder Ones]].
*   Their expansion onto land might have been halted by the arrival of the [[Star-Weavers]].
*   Their bio-engineering could be the source of various monstrous creatures plaguing the Khemri world.
*   Khemri worship of [[Nefet]], the River-Mother, might be an echo or adaptation of ancient Serpent Sovereign beliefs.

## Mysteries
*   What was their true physical form?
*   What entities did they worship in the depths?
*   What specific bio-forms did they create, and do any survive unchanged?
*   What treasures or dangers lie within their submerged cities?

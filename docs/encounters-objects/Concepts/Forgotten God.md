# Forgotten God

**Type:** Concept / Lore Entity
**Origin:** Pre-Khemri or Obscure Khemri Cult

## Description
A deity or powerful entity that is no longer widely worshipped or remembered by the mainstream Khemri civilization. Knowledge of such gods might persist in remote communities, fragmented texts, or be hinted at by unusual ruins or artifacts.

## Properties
*   **Nature:** Could be an older Khemri deity, a Precursor entity misinterpreted as a god, a nature spirit, or something else entirely.
*   **Worship:** Likely involved different rituals and beliefs than the current Khemri Pantheon. Shrines would be distinct in style or location.
*   **Knowledge:** Rediscovering information about a Forgotten God could provide unique lore insights, potential quest hooks, or even dangers if the entity or its lingering influence is hostile.

## Associations
*   Hidden shrines [[Encounters/discovery_encounter_18]], obscure cults, ancient ruins, fragmented inscriptions.
*   Possibly connected to specific regions, natural phenomena, or Precursor legacies.

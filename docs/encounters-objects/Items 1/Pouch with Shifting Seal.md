# Pouch with Shifting Seal

**Type:** Unique Artifact / Container
**Origin:** Unknown (Likely Precursor - Star-Weaver or Chronomancer influence)

## Description

A small pouch crafted from a slick, dark, non-leather material that feels unnaturally cool to the touch. It seems highly resistant to wear and damage. Its most striking feature is the metallic coil mechanism that serves as its seal. This coil subtly but constantly shifts and rearranges itself, sometimes briefly resembling known symbols (like the serpent of [[Nefet]]) before resolving into complex, non-Khemri geometric patterns. The pouch emits a faint, almost sub-audible hum, suggesting a contained energy source or active mechanism.

## Known History

*   Found near the [[Serpent's Tooth]] rocks landmark on the track to [[Khenet Oasis]], amidst signs of a violent struggle involving unknown creatures (leaving ichor/chitin) and potentially the [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]].
*   Contained unusually pure Copper Shards when found.

## Properties & Function

*   **Sealing Mechanism:** Opens with a specific touch or mental command (?), or perhaps randomly. The shifting patterns might indicate its status or be a form of security.
*   **Material:** Highly durable, cool to touch. Possibly offers minor protection to contents (preservation? shielding?).
*   **Energy Signature:** Emits a faint hum. Could potentially interact with other Precursor technology or locations.
*   **Contents:** Can hold small items like mundane containers.

## Mysteries

*   What is the exact nature and origin of the material and seal (Star-Weaver? Chronomancer?)?
*   What powers the hum and shifting?
*   Does the pouch have functions beyond simple storage (e.g., key, scanner, communication device)?
*   Who did it belong to originally, and what creature attacked them?
*   Why did it contain only simple (though pure) Copper Shards?

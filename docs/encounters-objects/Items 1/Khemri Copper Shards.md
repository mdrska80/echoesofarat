# Khemri Copper Shards

**Type:** Currency / Commodity
**Origin:** [[The Khemri Civilization]]

## Description
The most basic form of currency used by the Khemri people. These are typically crudely cut or stamped pieces of copper, varying slightly in size and weight.

## Variations
*   **Standard Shards:** Common currency, often impure or worn.
*   **Unusually Pure Shards:** Sometimes found in Precursor contexts ([[Pouch with Shifting Seal]]) or temple treasuries, suggesting advanced refinement methods or ceremonial value.
*   Higher denominations (Silver, Obsidian?) may exist but are much rarer.

## Use
Used for everyday trade and barter throughout the Khemri lands.

## Mysteries
*   Where does the unusually pure copper originate? Remnants of Precursor mining/refining, or specific Khemri techniques?

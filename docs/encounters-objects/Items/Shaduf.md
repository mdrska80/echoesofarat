**Type:** Item / Structure / Tool
**Origin:** Khemri / Ancient (Near Eastern invention)

## Description
A hand-operated device used for lifting water, primarily for irrigation. It consists of a long pole balanced on a support frame, with a bucket attached to one end and a counterweight (often mud or stone) at the other. This allows water to be lifted from a river, canal, or well to higher ground with less effort.

## Properties
*   **Functionality:** Enables irrigation of fields not immediately adjacent to a water source. Significantly improves agricultural potential.
*   **Durability:** Wooden structure is susceptible to rot, decay, and breakage. Requires maintenance.
*   **Value:** Low intrinsic value (made of common materials), but represents significant labor investment and agricultural technology.

## Associations
*   Found near farmland, canals, river banks, wells in agricultural regions. [[Encounters/discovery_encounter_24]]
*   Symbolic of Khemri agriculture and life along [[The Great River Arat]].

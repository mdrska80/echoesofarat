## Description
A popular ancient Khemri board game, often played on a rectangular board with 30 squares arranged in three rows of ten. Players race their pieces across the board based on throws of casting sticks or knucklebones. Boards can range from simple grids scratched onto surfaces to elaborate inlaid wooden boxes.

## Properties

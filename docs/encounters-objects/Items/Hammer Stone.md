# Hammer Stone

**Type:** Item / Tool
**Origin:** Khemri / Common (Primitive)

## Description
A basic striking tool consisting of a suitably shaped, hard river stone or quarried rock. It might be used as-is or hafted onto a simple wooden handle (though less common for basic hammer stones). Used for rough shaping, breaking rocks, driving stakes, or as a primitive weapon.

## Properties
*   **Functionality:** Delivers blunt force impact. Less precise than a [[encounters-objects/Items/Mallet]].
*   **Durability:** Very durable stone head, but can crack or shatter with extreme impacts. Hafting, if present, is a weak point.
*   **Value:** Extremely common, negligible trade value unless exceptionally well-shaped or made of unusual stone.

## Associations
*   Found commonly in quarries, construction sites, campsites, primitive workshops.
*   Used by laborers, quarriers, or as an improvised tool/weapon.

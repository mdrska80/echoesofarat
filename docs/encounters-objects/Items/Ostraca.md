# Ostraca

**Type:** Item / Artifact / Lore Item (Collection)
**Origin:** Khemri

## Description
Shards of pottery or flakes of limestone used as a common writing surface for everyday purposes by the Khemri, essentially ancient scratch paper. They often bear mundane texts like receipts, letters, work logs, tallies, school exercises, or rough sketches.

## Properties
*   **Functionality:** Primarily lore items. Reading them requires *[Archaeology]* or *[Literacy]*. Most contain trivial information, but occasionally a valuable clue, name, date, or map fragment might be found amongst a collection.
*   **Value:** Individual ostraca have negligible value unless bearing significant information. A large collection might have minor value to a scholar.
*   **Weight:** Individual shards are light, but a collection can be bulky.

## Associations
*   Found commonly in ruins of settlements, administrative buildings, schools, workshops, quarries, worker villages, even tombs (as minor records).
*   Represent the daily life and literacy levels of the Khemri.

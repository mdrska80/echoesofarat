# Bronze Saw

**Type:** Item / Tool
**Origin:** Khemri (Likely) / Ancient

## Description
A cutting tool consisting of a flat bronze blade with teeth set along one edge, typically attached to a wooden handle or frame. Used for cutting wood or softer stone.

## Properties
*   **Functionality:** Allows for sawing through materials. Effectiveness depends on the material, blade sharpness, and user skill.
*   **Durability:** Bronze teeth can dull quickly with use, especially on hard materials. Blade can bend or break under stress.
*   **Value:** Moderate trade value, higher than a simple chisel due to complexity. More valuable if ancient and well-preserved.

## Associations
*   Found in workshops (carpentry, masonry), construction sites, potentially in tombs as grave goods for craftsmen.
*   Less common than basic chisels or hammers.

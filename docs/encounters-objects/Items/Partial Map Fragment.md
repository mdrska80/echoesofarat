# Partial Map Fragment

**Type:** Item / Quest Item / Clue
**Origin:** Khemri (Likely) / Found Object

## Description
A shard of broken Khemri pottery (ostracon) bearing crudely etched lines and symbols on one side. The markings appear to be a partial map, though the scale, orientation, and full location depicted are unclear without more context or additional fragments.

## Properties
*   **Functionality:** Acts as a clue or quest item. Hints at a nearby location of potential interest (e.g., hidden resource, minor ruin, cache, unmarked tomb).
*   **Value:** Little intrinsic value, but high value as information if the map can be deciphered or completed.
*   **Weight:** Light.

## Associations
*   Found in ruins, old campsites, discarded debris piles.
*   May require *[Archaeology]* or *[Observation]* skill to recognize the markings as a map.
*   Might be part of a larger set of fragments needed to reveal a significant location.

# Whispering Geode Fragment

*   **Type:** Precursor Artifact Fragment
*   **Description:** A fragment broken from a geode. Instead of crystalline structures, the interior face is smooth, dark, and metallic-looking, absorbing light strangely. It might have faint, pulsing geometric patterns visible under close inspection. It occasionally emits a barely perceptible hum or vibration.
*   **Origin:** Likely a natural geode formation that incorporated materials or energies left behind by the [[encounters-objects/Civilizations/Star-Weavers]].
*   **Potential Uses:** Unknown. Might be valuable to collectors of strange artifacts, [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]], or potentially used in crafting if Star-Weaver technology is ever understood.
*   **Related Encounters:** `[[Encounters/discovery_encounter_61]]`
*   **Mysteries:** What powers the hum? What is the material? Does it have any function?

# Geode

**Type:** Item / Natural Object / Trade Good
**Origin:** Natural Formation

## Description
A rough, generally spherical rock, unassuming on the outside. When broken or cracked open, it reveals a hollow interior lined with mineral crystals (often quartz or amethyst analogs).

## Properties
*   **Functionality:** Primarily a curiosity or minor trade good. The quality and type of crystals determine its value.
*   **Value:** Variable, from low (common quartz) to moderate (well-formed or colorful crystals). Might have minor esoteric uses if specific crystals are involved.
*   **Weight:** Moderate for its size.

## Associations
*   Found in rocky areas, quarries, caves, areas with past volcanic or geological activity.
*   Requires a hard impact (e.g., with a [[encounters-objects/Items/Hammer Stone|Hammer Stone]]) to open without damaging the crystals.

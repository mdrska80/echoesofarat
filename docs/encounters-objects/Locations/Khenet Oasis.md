# Khenet Oasis

**Type:** Location / Oasis
**Region:** The Red Waste

## Description
A vital source of water and relative safety within the harsh expanse of the Red Waste. It's marked by a cluster of hardy desert palms and shrubs surrounding a series of interconnected natural pools fed by an underground spring. The water is potable, though sometimes brackish.

## Significance
*   A crucial waypoint for travelers, traders, and nomads crossing the Red Waste.
*   Often serves as a temporary trading post or meeting point.
*   [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] frequently linger nearby, either to trade, resupply, or prey on weaker travelers.
*   Control or access to the oasis is often contested, though rarely through open warfare, more often through intimidation or temporary dominance by stronger groups.

## Environment
*   Provides shade, water, and some sparse vegetation.
*   The immediate area around the pools can support some life, attracting desert creatures.
*   The relative safety is deceptive; ambushes are common just beyond the oasis's immediate vicinity.

## Mysteries
*   Is the underground spring purely natural, or is it tapped or enhanced by unseen Precursor technology?
*   Are there older, forgotten settlements buried beneath the sands near the oasis?

# Bees

**Type:** Fauna / Creature (Insect Swarm)
**Region:** Areas with flowering plants, trees, rocky clefts suitable for hives.

## Description
Social insects known for producing [[encounters-objects/Items/Honey|Honey]] and [[encounters-objects/Items/Beeswax|Beeswax]]. Live in colonies (hives) which they defend aggressively.

## Behavior & Ecology
*   Gather nectar and pollen from flowers.
*   Build wax combs within their hive (natural cavity, pot, or constructed hive).
*   Will swarm and sting intruders perceived as threats to the hive.
*   A large swarm can be dangerous or even lethal.

## Significance
*   Source of valuable resources ([[encounters-objects/Items/Honey|Honey]], [[encounters-objects/Items/Beeswax|Beeswax]]). [[Encounters/discovery_encounter_26]]
*   Represent both opportunity (resources) and danger (stings).
*   Their presence indicates nearby flowering vegetation.

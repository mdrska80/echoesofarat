# Desert Lion

**Type:** Fauna / Creature
**Region:** Savannas, rocky hills, fringes of the desert, less arid regions.

## Description
A large feline predator, adapted to the Khemri environment. May appear slightly leaner or have a tawny coat compared to typical African lions. Males possess manes, though perhaps less thick than commonly depicted.

## Behavior & Ecology
*   Apex predator, hunting primarily medium-to-large mammals like [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Gazelle|Gazelles]], wild asses, or sometimes livestock.
*   Live and hunt in social groups known as prides, typically consisting of related females, their offspring, and one or more adult males.
*   Territorial, marking their boundaries and defending them from rivals.
*   Often hunt cooperatively.
*   Rest during the hottest parts of the day.

## Significance
*   A significant danger to travelers and livestock in areas they inhabit.
*   Their presence often indicates a relatively healthy ecosystem with sufficient prey.
*   Holding territory implies control over resources in that area [[Encounters/discovery_encounter_8]].
*   May be seen as symbols of power or royal authority by Khemri.

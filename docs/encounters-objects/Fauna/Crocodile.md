# Crocodile

**Type:** Fauna / Creature / Reptile
**Region:** [[The Great River Arat]], large oases, marshes.

## Description
A large, heavily armored aquatic reptile, perfectly adapted for ambushing prey at the water's edge. Possesses powerful jaws, sharp teeth, and surprising speed over short distances on land or in water.

## Behavior & Ecology
*   Apex predator in aquatic environments.
*   Ambushes prey (fish, birds, mammals including humans) that come near the water.
*   Often basks motionless on riverbanks or floats disguised as logs.
*   Territorial, especially large males.
*   Worshipped or feared by Khemri, sometimes associated with river deities (possibly echoes of [[encounters-objects/Civilizations/Serpent Sovereigns]]?).

## Significance
*   A major hazard for anyone traveling near or on the water.
*   Their presence indicates permanent [[Water]] sources.
*   Hide and teeth may be valuable materials if obtainable.
*   Tracking them requires specific knowledge of their habits. [[Encounters/discovery_encounter_8]]

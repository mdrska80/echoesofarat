# Scavengers of the Red Waste

**Type:** Faction / Group
**Region:** The Red Waste

## Description
A loose collective of desperate individuals, exiled tribespeople, and opportunistic raiders who eke out a living in the harsh expanse of the Red Waste. They are not a unified nation or tribe but rather disparate groups bound by the need to survive in one of the most unforgiving environments.

## Organization & Structure
*   Typically operate in small, nomadic bands or war parties.
*   Leadership is usually based on strength, cunning, or the ability to provide resources.
*   Alliances between groups are temporary and often broken.
*   Some groups may have established semi-permanent camps near vital resources like [[Khenet Oasis]] or in defensible positions like the ruins near [[Serpent's Tooth]].

## Activities & Behavior
*   **Scavenging:** Their primary activity involves searching ruins and forgotten sites for Precursor artifacts, scrap metal, water, food, or anything of value.
*   **Raiding:** Frequently prey on travelers, trade caravans, or weaker scavenger groups. Ambushes near oases are common.
*   **Territorial Disputes:** Fiercely protective of any resource node or ruin they currently control, leading to frequent conflicts with other scavenger bands or outsiders.
*   **Trading:** Occasionally trade scavenged goods or information at remote outposts or with shadowy figures like [[Nefet]].

## Beliefs & Culture
*   Survival is paramount. Morality is often flexible.
*   Superstitious, with a healthy fear (and sometimes reverence) for the Precursor ruins and the strange phenomena of the Red Waste.
*   May incorporate salvaged Precursor tech into their gear or settlements, often without fully understanding it.

## Notable Figures / Groups
*   Various warlords or band leaders rise and fall.
*   [[Nefet]] is rumored to have influence or dealings with some scavenger groups, but the nature of this connection is unclear.

## Mysteries
*   Are there any larger, more organized scavenger alliances hidden within the Waste?
*   What knowledge have they truly gleaned from the ruins they inhabit?
*   What deals have been struck with figures like [[Nefet]]?

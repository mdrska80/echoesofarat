# Echoes of Khemri - Lore Document

This document compiles lore details about the Khemri civilization, its world, its history, the precursor civilizations that came before, and the mysteries surrounding them.

## The Khemri Civilization

The current dominant civilization dwelling among the ruins of ages past. Their society is largely pre-industrial (akin to a bronze or early iron age / medieval period), relying on agriculture along the Great River Arat, basic metalworking, and masonry. Their recorded history stretches back only a few millennia, viewing the colossal ruins and strange artifacts around them as the work of giants, demons, or earlier, legendary Khemri dynasties, largely unaware of the true depth, number, or nature of the Precursor Civilizations.

## Khemri Pantheon

*   **A'shar (The Sun-Father):** God of the Sun, Life, Fire, Cycles, Order. Depicted as a winged sun disk or a radiant figure. His temples are often aligned with solar events. Primary temples in A'shar's Resplendence. His symbol is the winged sun disk.
*   **Nefet (The River-Mother):** Goddess of the Great River Arat, Fertility, Rain, Secrets, Illusions. Often shown as a coiled serpent or a veiled woman. Associated with oases and hidden knowledge. Main cult center in the City of the Serpent's Coil. Her symbol, a coiled serpent, may appear on cult items, sometimes rendered in metal. Sometimes associated with legends of ancient water-dwelling beings.
*   **Ur-Ghul (The Star-Shepherd):** God of the Underworld (the 'Dust Veil'), Judgment, Stars, Fate, Prophecy. Appears as a jackal-headed figure whose eyes reflect the night sky. Guides souls and interprets celestial omens. Star charts are sometimes considered sacred to him. Some interpretations link his 'guiding souls through darkness' role to navigating ancient tunnels.
*   **K'thos (The Desert Fury):** God of Storms, Chaos, the Red Waste, Madness, Strength. Manifests as a swirling sandstorm or a monstrous beast. Both feared and invoked by desert dwellers and raiders. His chaotic nature is sometimes blamed for strange occurrences or dangerous ruins.

## Precursor Civilizations & Epochs

The Khemri are merely the latest inhabitants. At least four major precursor civilizations (and possibly countless minor ones or offshoots) rose and fell, leaving layered ruins and perplexing artifacts. The exact timeline is lost, but scholars speculate based on ruin strata and fragmented legends:

*   **Epoch 1 - The Primordial Age: The [[encounters-objects/Civilizations/Elder Ones]] (Deep Dwellers)**
    *   **Characteristics:** The oldest known intelligence. Possibly non-biological or existing in dimensions beyond Khemri comprehension. Associated with shaping the deep earth, cyclopean masonry of impossible scale, tunnels that seem to warp space, and artifacts made of cool, obsidian-like materials exhibiting impossible/non-Euclidean geometry that can cause disorientation or discomfort. Their motives and ultimate fate are utterly unknown. They may not have had 'technology' as understood, but manipulated fundamental forces.
    *   **Remnants:** Deep, geometrically unnatural tunnels; foundations of cyclopean structures; mind-bending artifacts; areas where reality feels thin or strangely angled.
    *   **Consequences:** Their deep structures may form the inaccessible bedrock beneath later ruins. Their influence might linger as psychic residue or spatial anomalies.

*   **Epoch 2 - The Abyssal Age: The [[encounters-objects/Civilizations/Serpent Sovereigns]] (Abyssal Architects)**
    *   **Characteristics:** An advanced, possibly reptilian or amphibian civilization that mastered the planet's oceans and waterways before expanding to land. Legends hint at potent bio-engineering (creating strange beasts, perhaps influencing Khemri fauna?) and hydro-technology. May have worshipped vast, abyssal entities.
    *   **Remnants:** Submerged ruins (domes, towers) in the Great River Arat or coastal depths; strange biological specimens preserved in fluid; intricate canal systems predating Khemri work; glyphs featuring serpent or wave motifs; potential biological artifacts.
    *   **Consequences:** Their rise may have conflicted with lingering Elder One influence. Their ruins present unique underwater exploration challenges. Their bio-engineering might be the source of some monstrous creatures in the Khemri world. Khemri reverence for Nefet might echo ancient Serpent Sovereign worship.

*   **Epoch 3 - The Stellar Age: The [[encounters-objects/Civilizations/Star-Weavers]] (Sky-Sailors)**
    *   **Characteristics:** The most technologically recognizable precursors. Interstellar travelers who 'sailed the silver void'. Masters of advanced alloys ('star-metal'), potent energy sources (mistaken for 'eternal flames'), sophisticated computation/AI, and potentially stable portal technology for transit between locations (or worlds?). Their aesthetic is often described as smooth, elegant, sometimes incorporating organic curves alongside advanced tech.
    *   **Remnants:** Crashed or hidden void-ships; underground bases/laboratories often powered by humming energy sources; artifacts of star-metal; stable portal frames (often inactive); data crystals or archives; advanced tools and devices; genetically distinct flora/fauna.
    *   **Consequences:** Their arrival may have displaced or destroyed remnants of the Serpent Sovereigns. Their departure is linked to the 'Year of Skyfall' - possibly a cataclysm, war, or consequence of Chronomancer activity. Their hidden bases might contain functional (or dangerous) technology. Their portals might be reactivated.

*   **Epoch 4 - The Temporal Age: The [[encounters-objects/Civilizations/Chronomancers]] (Temporal Weavers)**
    *   **Characteristics:** The most enigmatic and potentially dangerous precursors. They appear to have achieved mastery over time itself. Their existence is inferred from paradoxes, temporal anomalies, and artifacts that seem unstuck in time. It is unknown if they were a distinct species, an evolution of the Star-Weavers, or something else entirely. Their motives are inscrutable.
    *   **Remnants:** Locations stuck in time loops; areas where past/future events bleed into the present; artifacts that phase in and out of existence or show impossible causal loops; unstable temporal portals/rifts; individuals or creatures displaced in time.
    *   **Consequences:** May have directly caused the 'Year of Skyfall' and the Star-Weavers' disappearance through temporal warfare or mishap. Their unstable portals and paradoxes represent extreme hazards. Their actions may have fragmented history, making accurate timelines impossible.

*   **Epoch 5 - The Long Silence:** The period after the major precursors vanished, before the Khemri rose to prominence. An age of recovery, ruin, and slow ecological/geological change.
*   **Epoch 6 - The Khemri Dawn:** The current age.

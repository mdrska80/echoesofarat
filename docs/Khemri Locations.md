## 1. A'shar's Resplendence (The Sun City)

**(Type: Major City, Capital)**

*   **Location:** Situated on a strategic, elevated bank on the eastern side of the [[The Great River Arat]], commanding vast views over the fertile [[Khem-ta|Black Land]]. Positioned to catch the first rays of the dawn sun.
*   **Appearance:** A sprawling metropolis, the largest in Khemri, built primarily of sun-dried mudbrick and vast quantities of quarried limestone and sandstone. Dominated by the colossal Great Temple of [[A'shar (The Sun-Father)]], a multi-courtyard complex aligned precisely with solar events, its gilded capstone (or perhaps a misunderstood [[Star-Weavers]] energy reflector?) blazing in the sunlight. The Royal Palace of the [[Sun-Kings|Sun-King]] ([[Aran IV]]) adjoins the temple complex. Massive defensive walls, incorporating older structures and perhaps even repurposed Precursor masonry in their foundations, encircle the city proper. Districts include temple precincts, noble estates (walled compounds), bustling market areas [[Bustling Town Market]], artisan quarters, densely packed commoner housing, and sprawling necropolises on the outskirts. The riverfront features extensive docks and granaries. The air is often thick with dust, incense from temples, and the smells of crowded city life.
*   **Inhabitants:** The seat of Khemri power. Home to [[Aran IV]] and the [[Royal Court & Bureaucracy]], the highest echelons of the [[Priesthood of A'shar (The Sunlit Path)]], numerous [[High Nobility & High Priests|nobles]], [[Lesser Nobility & Bureaucrats|bureaucrats]], [[Scribes]], [[Artisans & Craftspeople|artisans]], [[Merchants & Traders]], temple functionaries, soldiers ([[Wardens]]), [[Laborers & Servants|laborers]], and a vast population of commoners [[Rekhyt]]. Foreign envoys (if any) or tribute bearers would reside here in designated quarters.
*   **Significance:** The political, religious, and symbolic heart of the Khemri kingdom. All major state decisions, religious festivals, and royal decrees emanate from here. Control of the Resplendence equates to control of Khemri. It is a center of learning (within Khemri constraints), trade, and power projection.
*   **Known Dangers:** Urban hazards (crime, disease, fires), political intrigue, potential crackdowns by [[Wardens]] or temple authorities, crowds, navigating complex social protocols. Spies from rival factions ([[Serpent Cultists]], [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]]) likely operate within the city.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   What Precursor structures might lie beneath the foundations of the Great Temple or Royal Palace?
    *   Do noble families hoard misunderstood Precursor artifacts ([[Star-Metal Sun Amulet]]) within their estates?
    *   Are there hidden archives holding records deemed heretical after the [[The Serpent Heresy|Serpent Heresy]]?
    *   Can players gain audiences with key figures to acquire patronage, information, or special permits?
    *   Where do the [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]] maintain their clandestine presence within the capital?
    *   The city's vast underbelly (sewers, old cellars, potentially forgotten tunnels) could hide secrets or dangers.

---

## 2. Dustfall Outpost

**(Type: Frontier Settlement, Military/Trade Post)**

*   **Location:** Situated strategically in the western [[The Whispering Sands]], likely near a minor oasis or reliable well system, possibly controlling a pass or ancient trade route. Positioned near significant, though poorly understood, Precursor ruins.
*   **Appearance:** A fortified settlement, much smaller and rougher than A'shar's Resplendence. Walls are likely thick mudbrick reinforced with local stone, perhaps incorporating salvaged Precursor blocks exhibiting unusual resilience or strange markings. Buildings are functional rather than ornate – barracks for the [[Wardens]] garrison, a sturdy governor's house (for [[Warden Iymeru]]?), trading posts, storehouses, maybe a small shrine [[Small Shrine (Local deity)]] dedicated to A'shar or Ur-Ghul. The 'dust' in its name is literal – the outpost is constantly battling windblown sand. Evidence of nearby ruins might be visible – unnatural rock formations, half-buried structures, occasional strange debris.
*   **Inhabitants:** Primarily garrisoned by [[Wardens]] under [[Warden Iymeru]]. Also home to hardy settlers, merchants trading with desert nomads ([[Nomadic Encampment (Bedouin)]]), prospectors, [[Scribes]] assigned to the administration, maybe a few low-ranking priests, and various support personnel. Transient population includes caravan masters, nomads, [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] (passing through cautiously), and possibly discreet agents of other factions ([[Seekers of the Veiled Path]]?).
*   **Significance:** Represents Khemri authority on the edge of the known world. A vital point for monitoring desert tribes, protecting trade routes, and importantly, observing and potentially containing the influence of nearby Precursor sites. Warden Iymeru's appointment suggests the location is considered strategically important or troublesome. It's a place where the order of Khemri directly confronts the chaos ([[Isfet]]) of the deep desert and the unsettling legacy of the past.
*   **Known Dangers:** Raids by [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]], harsh environmental conditions (sandstorms [[Tjau-aat]], heat), scarcity of resources (water, fresh food), potential threats emerging from nearby ruins (creatures, anomalies), the suspicious and possibly heavy-handed authority of the [[Wardens]].
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   What specific Precursor ruins lie near Dustfall Outpost? [[Elder Ones]]? [[Star-Weavers]]? Both?
    *   What event or discovery led to the disgrace of [[Scribe Vorin 'the Lesser']] here? Did he find something dangerous or heretical?
    *   What undocumented threats do Warden Iymeru and his garrison deal with regularly?
    *   Are the Wardens actively exploring/exploiting the ruins, or merely containing them?
    *   Could the outpost itself be built *on top* of a significant Precursor structure?
    *   This is a prime location to find rumors ([[Rumor/Information Broker]]) about deep desert locations or hire guides.
    *   The proximity to ruins makes it a potential hotspot for [[Precursor Anomaly]] encounters or finding unique artifacts.

## 3. Khenet Oasis

**(Type: Natural Landmark, Contested Resource)**

*   **Location:** A significant oasis located deep within [[The Whispering Sands]], possibly several days' travel from the nearest permanent Khemri settlement (perhaps [[Dustfall Outpost]]?). Fed by a reliable underground spring.
*   **Appearance:** A depression in the desert floor, marked by a dense grove of [[Date Palm Grove|date palms]] and other hardy vegetation. Features one or more pools of relatively clear water [[Khen-mw]]. Might contain crumbling Khemri-era structures (an old waystation, an abandoned shrine) or even subtle hints of Precursor influence (unusual rock formations near the spring, perhaps evidence of ancient [[Serpent Sovereigns]] water management). The air is noticeably cooler and more humid than the surrounding desert. Signs of temporary encampments (fire pits, cleared areas) are common.
*   **Inhabitants:** No permanent Khemri population. Frequented by [[Nomadic Encampment (Bedouin)|desert nomads]], [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] (who might attempt to control it), traveling merchants, [[Wardens]] patrols, and independent explorers (like the player's NPCs). Control is often temporary and contested.
*   **Significance:** A vital source of water and shade in the deep desert, making it a crucial waypoint for travelers and a strategic asset for anyone operating in the region. Control of Khenet Oasis allows projection of power deeper into the Whispering Sands. It's a natural focal point for interaction, trade, and conflict between different groups.
*   **Known Dangers:** Ambushes by [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] or other hostile groups vying for control. Depletion of resources (water levels dropping in dry periods, over-foraging). Dangerous wildlife attracted to the water. Potential for conflict between different groups meeting unexpectedly. The water itself might occasionally become tainted ([[Mw-qed]]), perhaps naturally or due to nearby Precursor contamination.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   Does the oasis water have unusual properties? (Healing? Hallucinogenic? Linked to [[Nefet (The River-Mother)]]?)
    *   Are there hidden Precursor structures related to the spring's source? Could it be an ancient [[Serpent Sovereigns]] well or filtration system?
    *   Do specific factions ([[Seekers of the Veiled Path]]?) use the oasis as a secret meeting point or cache location?
    *   Ancient carvings or inscriptions might exist on rocks within the oasis, offering clues to past events or lost routes.
    *   The oasis could be a temporary hub for unique [[Rumor/Information Broker|rumors]] or rare trade goods not found elsewhere.
    *   Environmental changes (water level shifts, unusual plant/animal behavior) could foreshadow larger events or dangers.

## 4. Elder One Tunnel Network Entrance (Example Ruin Type)

**(Type: Precursor Ruin Entrance, Anomaly Zone)**

*   **Location:** Variable. Could be found in deep desert rock formations [[The Whispering Sands]], hidden within mountain cave systems [[Djew]], beneath existing Khemri ruins [[Dustfall Outpost]], or even accessible via submerged passages [[The Great River Arat]]. The entrance itself might be subtle or monumental.
*   **Appearance:** Highly variable, but characterized by [[Elder Ones]] aesthetics. Could be a perfectly smooth, cyclopean archway leading into darkness; a fissure in reality where the rock seems to fold inwards unnaturally; a section of ground that descends via non-Euclidean geometry; or a seemingly natural cave whose walls quickly become impossibly smooth, cool to the touch, and angled disconcertingly. The air near the entrance might feel 'thin', 'wrong', or carry a low, sub-audible hum. Light behaves strangely near or within the entrance. No Khemri construction is usually present, unless they attempted to seal it (likely ineffectually).
  ![[Pasted image 20250420003059.png]]
*   **Inhabitants:** Typically none in the conventional sense. May contain unique, perhaps non-biological, entities native to the tunnels, or creatures driven mad/mutated by the environment. Unwary explorers or desperate fugitives might occasionally venture inside, rarely returning unchanged.
  ![[Pasted image 20250420003236.png]]
*   **Significance:** Represents a direct gateway into the remnants of the oldest, most alien Precursor civilization. Offers potential access to profound secrets about reality, unique materials ([[Shard of Impossible Geometry]]), and unimaginable dangers. Likely feared and shunned by most Khemri, but of intense interest to groups like the [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]].
*   **Known Dangers:** Extreme psychological distress (vertigo, paranoia, madness) induced by the non-Euclidean geometry [[Psychic Resistance/Sensitivity]]. Spatial distortion (getting lost easily, passages looping or leading unpredictably). Temporal distortions (less common than [[Chronomancers|Chronomancer]] sites, but possible). Gravitational anomalies. Encounters with utterly alien or hostile entities. Potential for passages to abruptly seal or shift. Lack of breathable air or extreme temperatures in deeper sections. Conventional tools ([[Torches (Bundle)]]) may function erratically.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   Where do the tunnels ultimately lead? Other regions? Pocket dimensions? The planet's core?
    *   What purpose did these networks serve for the [[Elder Ones]]? Transport? Habitat? Something else?
    *   Can the spatial distortions be navigated reliably (perhaps using [[Geometric Seeds]] or specific artifacts)?
    *   Do different entrances connect to the same network, or are there multiple, isolated systems?
    *   Are there 'safe zones' within the network, or areas where other Precursor races attempted to establish footholds?
    *   What unique resources or knowledge can only be found within these tunnels?
    *   Exploring these tunnels is a high-risk, high-reward endeavor likely requiring specialized skills and mental fortitude.

## 5. The Sunken City of Yar'naath

**(Type: Precursor Ruin, Serpent Sovereign Origin)**

*   **Location:** Submerged beneath the waters of the [[The Great River Arat]], possibly in a deeper, wider section or an ancient delta now flooded. May only be partially visible during extreme low water periods.
*   **Appearance:** Domes, spires, and structures made of smooth, greenish, coral-like or basaltic material, showing signs of bio-luminescence even in the murky depths. Architecture features fluid lines, large conduits, and underwater pressure doors. Sections may be filled with air/different atmosphere, while others are flooded. Strange aquatic plants and creatures [[Serpent-Amphibian (Tekhen-nu)]] are common.
*   **Inhabitants:** Likely inhabited by [[Serpent Sovereign Coral Polyp Swarm|defensive bio-constructs]], [[Bio-Electric Eel (Weskhet-wa)|bio-electric eels]], [[Serpent-Amphibian (Tekhen-nu)|serpent-amphibians]], and potentially degenerate descendants of the original inhabitants or their servitors. [[Serpent Cultists]] may attempt pilgrimages or establish hidden shrines here.
*   **Significance:** A major remnant of the [[Serpent Sovereigns]] civilization, offering insights into their aquatic lifestyle, bio-engineering, and potentially advanced hydro-technology ([[Serpent Sovereign Filtration Valve]]). Likely holds valuable artifacts and dangerous secrets.
*   **Known Dangers:** Drowning, crushing pressure in deeper sections, aggressive bio-constructs, venomous creatures, malfunctioning hydro-tech, potential for encountering hostile cultists. Navigation requires [[Hydrology/Aquatic Adaptation]] skill and possibly specialized gear.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   What was the original purpose of Yar'naath? Capital? Research lab? Temple complex?
    *   Are there still functional Serpent Sovereign devices (power sources, genetic labs [[Serpent Sovereign Genetic Sequencer Fragment]]) within the city?
    *   Do passages connect Yar'naath to underground tunnel networks or other submerged locations?
    *   What caused the city to become submerged or abandoned? Conflict? Environmental change?
    *   Could [[Bio-luminescent Pearl]]s found here hold records or memories?

## 6. Mount Djew Peak & Star-Weaver Eyrie

**(Type: Natural Landmark / Precursor Ruin, Star-Weaver Origin)**

*   **Location:** The highest peak in the [[Djew]] mountain range bordering the eastern deserts. Summit is often snow-capped or shrouded in clouds.
*   **Appearance:** Jagged, imposing mountain peak. Near the summit, evidence of [[Star-Weavers]] construction becomes apparent – smooth 'star-metal' platforms fused to the rock, remnants of sensor arrays or communication towers, possibly a collapsed dome structure or sealed entrance. Thin atmosphere, strong winds.
*   **Inhabitants:** Few permanent inhabitants. Hardy mountain wildlife (goats, birds of prey). Possibly malfunctioning [[Star-Weaver Sentinel (Malfunctioning Automaton)|sentinels]] or [[Star-Weaver Phase Spider|phase spiders]] near the ruins. [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]] might maintain a hidden observation post.
*   **Significance:** Highest point in the region, offering incredible views. The Star-Weaver ruins suggest an observatory, communication hub, or atmospheric monitoring station. Vital strategic viewpoint.
*   **Known Dangers:** Extreme cold, thin air, treacherous climbing conditions (avalanches, rockfalls), high winds. Malfunctioning Star-Weaver defenses. Potential for gravitational anomalies [[Star-Weaver Gravity Modulator (Miniature)]] near ruins.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   What was the specific function of the Star-Weaver Eyrie? Does any equipment remain functional?
    *   Are there sealed entrances leading deeper into the mountain, possibly to a larger installation?
    *   Could the Eyrie have been involved in the [[Year of Skyfall]]? Was it a weapon platform, observation post, or something else?
    *   Does the altitude or location allow for unique astronomical observations or energy detection?
    *   What knowledge or artifacts ([[Star-Metal Sun Amulet]], [[Star-Weaver Diagnostic Tool]]) might be found among the wreckage?

---

## 7. Temple of Nefet at Per-Hapi

**(Type: Major Temple Complex, Khemri Religious Site)**

*   **Location:** Situated directly on the banks of [[The Great River Arat]], possibly incorporating a natural spring or island, in a fertile agricultural region [[Khem-ta|Black Land]]. Per-Hapi ('House of the Nile') would be the associated town/district.
*   **Appearance:** A sprawling temple complex built primarily of sandstone and limestone, distinct from the sun-focused temples of A'shar. Features open courtyards, pools filled with sacred fish or crocodiles, colonnades decorated with riverine motifs (lotus, papyrus, fish, hippos [[Hippopotamus (Deb)]]). Central shrine dedicated to [[Nefet (The River-Mother)], likely containing a sacred barque. Nilometers (river level measuring structures) are integrated into the complex. Might show signs of water damage from past floods.
*   **Inhabitants:** Large contingent of priests and priestesses dedicated to Nefet, temple administrators, [[Scribes]], artisans producing offerings, temple guards ([[Wardens]]), farmers working temple lands, pilgrims seeking blessings for fertility or safe river travel.
*   **Significance:** Major religious center dedicated to the vital River-Mother. Controls significant agricultural land and influences river trade/travel through rituals and blessings. Important site for measuring the inundation and predicting harvests. Potential rival power center to the [[Priesthood of A'shar (The Sunlit Path)]].
*   **Known Dangers:** Religious politics, potential conflicts with A'shar priests, risk of offending Nefet's priesthood, dangers associated with sacred animals (crocodiles, hippos), possibility of river flooding affecting parts of the complex.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   Do the priests of Nefet preserve ancient knowledge about river control or perhaps even forgotten [[Serpent Sovereigns]] hydro-lore?
    *   Are there hidden chambers beneath the temple accessible only via submerged passages?
    *   Does the temple hold artifacts related to water purity or fertility with genuine (minor) magical properties?
    *   Could players gain the favor of Nefet's priesthood for specific boons (safe passage, information on river routes, healing)?
    *   What secrets do the Nilometer readings hold beyond simple flood prediction?

---

## 8. The Obsidian Quarries of K'thos' Fury

**(Type: Resource Site / Hazard Zone)**

*   **Location:** Within a geologically active volcanic region, possibly near the edge of [[The Whispering Sands]] or within the [[Djew]] mountains. Could be linked to [[K'thos (The Desert Fury)]].
*   **Appearance:** Stark landscape of black volcanic rock, obsidian flows, steaming fissures, and sharp glassy shards littering the ground. Active quarrying sites show signs of Khemri labor (chipped rock faces, discarded tools, simple shelters), but often look hastily abandoned. Air smells of sulfur. Ground may be unstable or unnaturally hot in places.
*   **Inhabitants:** Few permanent inhabitants due to danger. Khemri quarry workers (often convicts or forced labor) operate sporadically under [[Wardens]] supervision. [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] might risk entering to find obsidian for tools/weapons. Strange heat-adapted creatures or minor fire/magma elementals might dwell here.
*   **Significance:** Primary source of valuable obsidian used for sharp tools, weapons ([[Serpent Cultist Sacrificial Dagger]]?), mirrors, and ritual objects in Khemri. A dangerous but necessary resource extraction site. Its volatile nature links it thematically to K'thos.
*   **Known Dangers:** Extreme heat, toxic volcanic gases, unstable ground (collapses, fissures), razor-sharp obsidian fragments, potential for minor eruptions or lava flows. Aggressive creatures adapted to the heat. Harsh conditions lead to worker unrest or desperation.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   Is there a deeper connection between the quarries and K'thos? Does the god's influence manifest here?
    *   Are there veins of unusual materials mixed with the obsidian (e.g., strange metals, perhaps [[Elder Ones]] materials ejected from deep underground)?
    *   What causes the frequent abandonment of quarry sites? Creature attacks? Unexplained phenomena? Warden cruelty?
    *   Could the quarries hide entrances to subterranean passages or magma tubes leading elsewhere?
    *   Obsidian found here might hold unique properties or be needed for specific rituals/crafting.

---

## 9. Nomad Market Hub (Whispering Bazaar)

**(Type: Semi-Permanent Settlement / Interaction Point)**

*   **Location:** A specific, traditionally recognized location in [[The Whispering Sands]], perhaps a sheltered wadi [[Rocky Wadi (Dry riverbed)]] or a cluster of minor oases, not under direct Khemri control. Marked by ancient standing stones or distinctive rock formations.
*   **Appearance:** A sprawling, chaotic collection of tents, animal pens, and temporary stalls that appears and disappears with nomadic movements. Dominated by the smells of exotic spices, pack animals, and campfires. Various nomadic tribes ([[Nomadic Encampment (Bedouin)]]), desert traders, [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] (trading salvage), and even discreet [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]] might be present. Goods traded include salt, hides, rare herbs, salvaged minor artifacts, livestock, water rights information, and rumors.
*   **Inhabitants:** Transient population of various desert nomads, traders, scavengers, [[Rumor/Information Broker|information brokers]], and fugitives. No single authority, but governed by complex tribal customs and temporary truces.
*   **Significance:** A vital neutral ground for trade and information exchange outside Khemri authority. Allows interaction with diverse desert factions. A place to acquire rare goods, hire guides, or gather dangerous intelligence.
*   **Known Dangers:** Theft, scams, sudden outbreaks of tribal violence, harsh environment, suspicion from various factions, attracting attention from [[Wardens]] patrols if they monitor the area. Deals often involve complex bartering or favors.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   What ancient significance does the location itself hold? Why is it a traditional meeting place?
    *   Can players find unique precursor artifacts salvaged by nomads that haven't reached Khemri cities?
    *   Are secret meetings held here between major factions (Seekers, Serpent Cultists, rival nobles)?
    *   Can players navigate the complex web of tribal politics to gain allies or information?
    *   Unique rumors about deep desert ruins, legendary creatures, or hidden oases circulate here.

---

## 10. Chronomancer Paradox Field (The Shifting Sands)

**(Type: Anomaly Zone, Chronomancer Origin)**

*   **Location:** An area within [[The Whispering Sands]] where time behaves erratically. Might be centered on a ruined [[Chronomancers]] device or simply an area scarred by temporal warfare. Not marked on Khemri maps, avoided by locals.
*   **Appearance:** Visually disorienting. Landscape may shimmer, blur, or briefly show 'echoes' of past or potential future states (e.g., lush vegetation appearing then fading, Khemri soldiers marching where there are none, glimpses of Precursor structures). Sand might flow backwards, light refracts strangely. [[Dust of Frozen Moments]] might be present.
*   **Inhabitants:** Generally none, except perhaps creatures trapped in time loops [[Chronomancer Echo Knight]], [[Chronomancer Temporal Hound|temporal hounds]], or [[Chronovore Mote|chronovore motes]]. Desperate fugitives or obsessive [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]] might risk entry.
*   **Significance:** A hazardous zone showcasing the dangers of uncontrolled Chronomancer influence. Offers potential glimpses into other eras but at extreme risk. Might contain unique artifacts phased out of normal time.
*   **Known Dangers:** Unpredictable temporal shifts (rapid aging/de-aging, time loops, displacement), disorientation, risk of paradox, encounters with temporal creatures/anomalies. Navigation is extremely difficult ([[Temporal Sense/Anomaly Navigation]] critical). Conventional timekeeping fails.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   What caused the field? A specific event? A malfunctioning device [[Chronomancer Paradox Engine Core (Depleted)]]?
    *   Can the temporal shifts be predicted or controlled? Are there 'safe' paths or moments?
    *   Are valuable artifacts or lost individuals trapped within the field, potentially recoverable?
    *   Does the field hide an entrance to a Chronomancer facility existing outside normal time?
    *   Could collecting [[Dust of Frozen Moments]] here allow for minor temporal manipulations?

---

## 11. Scavenger King's Fortress (Rust-Tooth Hold)

**(Type: Faction Base / Repurposed Ruin)**

*   **Location:** Likely a heavily modified Khemri ruin [[Abandoned Mudbrick Settlement]] or minor Precursor structure [[Star-Weavers|Star-Weaver outpost?]], situated strategically in the [[The Whispering Sands]] or [[Badlands]]. Commands a view over surrounding territory or a contested resource (minor oasis, salvage field).
*   **Appearance:** Crumbling Khemri/Precursor architecture reinforced crudely with scrap metal, salvaged materials, and sharpened stakes. Defenses are ramshackle but numerous (pit traps, unstable walls rigged to collapse, watchtowers). Displays trophies (skulls, captured banners). Central structure houses the 'Scavenger King' [[Scavengers of the Red Waste Leader]]. Smoke from scrap forges is often visible.
*   **Inhabitants:** Strong force of [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] loyal to their leader. Includes warriors, crude artisans/mechanics, slaves/captives, and various desert creatures kept as pets or guards.
*   **Significance:** Major power base for a specific Scavenger tribe/warlord. Represents a significant threat to Khemri patrols ([[Wardens]]), trade caravans, and potentially smaller settlements like [[Dustfall Outpost]]. Controls local salvage operations.
*   **Known Dangers:** Heavily defended by numerous, desperate scavengers. Treacherous terrain and crude traps. Potential for disease/infection due to poor sanitation. Leader is likely paranoid and ruthless. Attack or infiltration is extremely hazardous.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   What specific ruin was repurposed? Does it hold Precursor secrets the Scavengers haven't recognized?
    *   Does the Scavenger King possess a unique or powerful artifact found in the ruins?
    *   Are there internal power struggles or rebellious captives offering opportunities for infiltration/destabilization?
    *   Could the fortress be hired for mercenary work or illicit trade?
    *   What specific territory or resource does this fortress allow the Scavengers to control?

---

## 12. Seeker's Hidden Archive (The Silent Library)

**(Type: Faction Base / Secret Location)**

*   **Location:** Extremely well-hidden. Could be beneath a mundane Khemri building in [[A'shar's Resplendence]], within a remote mountain cave system [[Djew]], inside a pocket dimension accessed via an [[Elder One Tunnel Network Entrance|Elder One portal]], or integrated into cleverly camouflaged Precursor ruins.
*   **Appearance:** Varies depending on location, but always designed for secrecy and defense. Likely features hidden entrances, traps (mundane and possibly Precursor-derived), magically sealed chambers, and areas designed for quiet study. Contains scrolls, codices, tablets, [[Shard of Impossible Geometry|Precursor artifacts]], star charts, and potentially dangerous texts deemed heretical by Khemri authorities. Atmosphere is hushed and studious, but tense.
  ![[Pasted image 20250420010031.png]]
*   **Inhabitants:** [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]] scholars, initiates, guardians, and possibly bound entities or constructs acting as librarians/sentinels. Leadership figures might reside or visit here.
*   **Significance:** A central repository of the Seekers' forbidden knowledge, covering Precursor lore, alternative histories, suppressed magic, and potentially dangerous truths about the cosmos or the Khemri gods. Accessing it is key to understanding the Seekers' motives and capabilities.
*   **Known Dangers:** Extreme difficulty in locating it. Lethal traps and guardians. Suspicious and secretive inhabitants. The knowledge itself can be dangerous (maddening truths, dangerous rituals). Discovery by Khemri authorities ([[Wardens]], [[Priesthood of A'shar (The Sunlit Path)]]) would be disastrous.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   How is the archive protected? What specific mechanisms or entities guard it?
    *   What unique or universe-shattering secrets does it hold? (e.g., True nature of [[A'shar (The Sun-Father)]]? Origins of the [[Elder Ones]]? A map to a major Precursor site?)
    *   Are there different levels of access within the archive? What knowledge is restricted even from initiates?
    *   Could the archive contain information needed to control or counteract specific Precursor threats?
    *   Gaining access (as ally, infiltrator, or captive) is a major quest objective.

---

## 13. Warden Training Grounds (Akhet-Nefer)

**(Type: Military Site / Settlement Outskirts)**

*   **Location:** Typically on the outskirts of a major city like [[A'shar's Resplendence]] or a large regional town. Requires open ground suitable for drills and exercises.
*   **Appearance:** A large, dusty field marked out for drills. Features may include archery targets, wooden training dummies [[Bronze Khopesh|scarred by weapons]], low obstacle walls, perhaps a small barracks or armory building, and observation towers for instructors. Usually fenced or walled off.
*   **Inhabitants:** [[Wardens]] recruits, veteran instructors, armorers, stablehands (if cavalry is used), possibly military [[Scribes]] keeping records. [[Bek (Guard)]] might have trained here.
*   **Significance:** Where Khemri soldiers are trained and disciplined. Represents the infrastructure supporting Khemri military power. A place to observe military practices, potentially recruit allies (or find rivals), or gather information about Warden patrols/deployments.
*   **Known Dangers:** Strictly controlled access. Suspicious guards. Risk of being mistaken for a spy or deserter. Training accidents might occur. Instructors are likely harsh.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   Are recruits taught specific techniques for dealing with Precursor threats or anomalous creatures, or is such knowledge restricted?
    *   Do instructors hold valuable combat knowledge or information about specific military campaigns/secrets?
    *   Could players infiltrate the grounds to steal equipment, rescue a captive, or eavesdrop on plans?
    *   Are there records here detailing Warden losses or encounters in specific regions (e.g., near [[Dustfall Outpost]])?
    *   Might be a source for rumors about military movements or factional tensions within the Wardens.

---

## 14. Valley of Whispering Tombs

**(Type: Necropolis / Ruin Field)**

*   **Location:** A large, desolate valley or plateau, likely near a former major settlement or traditional burial area, some distance from current cities. Could be partially buried by sand.
*   **Appearance:** A vast landscape dotted with countless Khemri tombs of varying sizes and ages – simple pit graves, [[Mastaba Field|mastabas]], [[Simple Rock-Cut Tomb (Minor Noble)|rock-cut tombs]]. Many show signs of ancient or recent looting (broken seals, scattered debris). Wind whistles through entrances, creating 'whispering' sounds. Some tombs might be intact, while others have collapsed. Faded hieroglyphs mark some entrances.
*   **Inhabitants:** Primarily the dead. [[Tomb Scarab Swarm|Tomb scarabs]], [[Desert Scorpion (Serqet's Sting)|scorpions]], [[Sand Viper (Hebenet)|vipers]], [[Scavenger Hyena (Shat)|hyenas]]. [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] or independent tomb robbers [[Sekhem (Tomb Robber)]] may frequent the area. Possibly haunted by restless spirits ([[Whispering Mummy (Khaibit's Echo)]]) or guarded by neglected [[Animated Khemri Statue (Tjet)|animated statues]].
*   **Significance:** A massive repository of Khemri history and potential wealth, but also danger and desecration. Represents generations of burial practices. Exploring here offers chances for archaeological finds ([[Canopic Jar Set (Alabaster)]], [[Senet Board Game]]), valuable grave goods, but also risks curses and encounters with guardians or scavengers.
*   **Known Dangers:** Tomb collapses, hidden pits, traps (mundane or magical), curses on disturbed burials, encounters with tomb guardians (scarabs, mummies, statues), competition/conflict with looters, environmental hazards (sandstorms).
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   Are there specific, legendary tombs hidden within the valley (e.g., a lost noble, a disgraced priest)?
    *   Do any tombs intersect with Precursor structures or tunnels lying beneath?
    *   Are there patterns or alignments to the tomb placements suggesting older surveys or forgotten beliefs?
    *   Could intact tombs hold valuable historical records (papyri) or unique artifacts?
    *   The 'whispering' winds – natural phenomenon, or something more sinister?

--- 

## 15. The Petrified Forest of Iset

**(Type: Natural Landmark / Anomaly Zone)**

*   **Location:** Likely situated in the deeper desert [[The Whispering Sands]] or bordering the [[Badlands]]. An area where an ancient forest has been completely petrified.
*   **Appearance:** A bizarre landscape filled with stone replicas of enormous, ancient trees, some still standing, others fallen and shattered. The 'wood' grain is perfectly preserved in stone (silica, agate, jasper). The ground is littered with petrified leaves and branches. The air feels unnaturally still and silent. Some trees might exhibit strange coloration or crystalline growths.
*   **Inhabitants:** Few living creatures. Possibly [[Desert Scorpion (Serqet's Sting)|scorpions]] or [[Sand Viper (Hebenet)|vipers]] adapted to the rocky terrain. Some legends speak of petrified creatures or people within the forest. Might attract [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]] studying geological or temporal anomalies. [[Rock Baboon (Ian)|Rock baboons]] might use the area for shelter.
*   **Significance:** A striking geological anomaly. The sheer age and perfect preservation raise questions. Was it a natural process, or influenced by Precursor activity? [[Chronomancers]] (temporal stasis followed by mineralization?) or [[Serpent Sovereigns]] (silicifying bio-agents?) could be implicated. Offers unique geological samples.
*   **Known Dangers:** Getting lost in the disorienting landscape. Sharp edges on shattered petrified wood. Lack of water/resources. Uneven, difficult terrain. The unsettling silence might affect morale. Some legends warn of a 'petrifying gaze' or curse associated with the area.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   What caused the petrification? Natural or Precursor?
    *   Are the legends of petrified creatures true? What might they reveal?
    *   Does the petrified wood hold trapped temporal echoes ([[Chronomancer Temporal Echo Recorder]]) or psychic impressions?
    *   Are there specific types of crystals or minerals found only here, perhaps useful in rituals or crafting?
    *   Could the 'forest' hide entrances to underground cave systems or buried structures?

## 16. Serpent Cultist Sanctum (The Coil)

**(Type: Faction Base / Hidden Temple)**

*   **Location:** Hidden, likely underground or within remote ruins. Could be beneath a Khemri city ([[A'shar's Resplendence]]?), inside natural caves adapted with [[Serpent Sovereigns]] motifs, or even within sections of [[The Sunken City of Yar'naath]] if accessible.
*   **Appearance:** Dark, damp, and oppressive. Architecture mimics Khemri temples but incorporates overt serpentine imagery (snake statues, carved scales, undulating corridors). Often features pools of murky water, sacrificial altars ([[Serpent Cultist Sacrificial Dagger]]), and chambers for forbidden rituals. May incorporate salvaged [[Serpent Sovereigns]] artifacts or organic components. Atmosphere thick with strange incense and fear.
*   **Inhabitants:** [[Serpent Cultists]] (initiates, priests, guards), possibly bound serpent creatures ([[Mire Serpent (Neheb-ka)]]?), or degenerate [[Serpent-Amphibian (Tekhen-nu)|human/serpent hybrids]]. Leaders might reside here.
*   **Significance:** A major center for the worship of forbidden serpent entities, likely linked to [[Serpent Sovereigns]] legacy or chaos gods. Site of dark rituals, sacrifices, and plotting against Khemri authorities. Destruction or infiltration is a major goal for [[Wardens]] or [[Priesthood of A'shar (The Sunlit Path)]].
*   **Known Dangers:** Fanatical cultists, treacherous architecture (hidden passages, traps), dangerous bound creatures, poisonous substances, corrupting influences, psychic traps or wards. Discovery means certain death or worse.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   What specific entity or power do the cultists worship here? Is it a true remnant of the Sovereigns, or something else?
    *   What forbidden knowledge or artifacts are stored within the Sanctum?
    *   Are they attempting to reactivate [[Serpent Sovereigns]] technology or awaken dormant entities?
    *   Who are the leaders, and what are their ultimate goals? (Overthrow [[Aran IV]]? Transform Khemri? Achieve personal apotheosis?)
    *   Could players find evidence linking specific Khemri nobles or priests to the cult?

## 17. Starfall Crater (Impact Site)

**(Type: Ruin Field / Anomaly Zone, Star-Weaver Origin?)**

*   **Location:** A large impact crater located deep in [[The Whispering Sands]] or [[Badlands]], possibly related to the [[Year of Skyfall]].
*   **Appearance:** A massive depression with fused, glassy sand (impactite) and strangely twisted rock formations at its center. Strewn with debris: fragments of 'star-metal', shards of unknown crystalline materials, wreckage of a [[Star-Weavers]] vessel or orbital structure. Residual energy readings might be detectable. Strange plants adapted to weird radiation/energy might grow here.
*   **Inhabitants:** Few living things. Possibly mutated creatures, energy-based life forms drawn to residual power, [[Star-Weaver Sentinel (Malfunctioning Automaton)|malfunctioning sentinels]], or desperate [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] picking through the debris.
*   **Significance:** Potential origin point for many [[Star-Weavers]] artifacts found in Khemri. Ground Zero for a major ancient event, possibly the Year of Skyfall itself. Holds clues about Star-Weaver technology, their fate, and the nature of the cataclysm.
*   **Known Dangers:** Residual radiation or energy fields, hazardous materials, unstable wreckage, defensive automatons, environmental anomalies (localized gravity shifts [[Star-Weaver Gravity Modulator (Miniature)]]?), attacks by mutated creatures or scavengers.

## 18. Hermit's Cave of Ur-Ghul

**(Type: Dwelling / Minor Religious Site)**

*   **Location:** A secluded cave, likely in the mountains [[Djew]] or remote desert cliffs [[Rocky Wadi (Dry riverbed)]], difficult to access. May have star charts painted near the entrance.
*   **Appearance:** Natural cave adapted for simple living. Contains a sleeping mat, meager supplies, perhaps a small shrine dedicated to [[Ur-Ghul (The Star-Shepherd)]] decorated with dark stones, star symbols, or found objects. May have extensive star charts painted or carved onto the walls. Atmosphere is quiet, contemplative, perhaps slightly eerie.
*   **Inhabitants:** A lone hermit, ascetic, or outcast priest devoted to Ur-Ghul. Likely possesses deep knowledge of stars, omens, desert survival, and perhaps unconventional theology. Might have animal companions (desert foxes [[Fennec Fox (Fenek)]], owls).
*   **Significance:** Represents isolated or non-mainstream religious practice focused on Ur-Ghul. A potential source of unique knowledge, prophecies, guidance (especially regarding night travel, death, or fate), or rare quests outside typical Khemri society.
*   **Known Dangers:** Hermit might be suspicious, hostile, or slightly mad from isolation. Cave could be difficult to reach or have natural hazards. Might attract nocturnal predators or spirits Ur-Ghul is associated with. Possessing forbidden knowledge could put the hermit (and visitors) at risk from authorities.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   Why did the hermit choose this life? What knowledge do they protect or seek?
    *   Do their star charts hold practical navigational secrets or prophetic insights?

    *   Is the hermit truly devout, or using the guise for other purposes (hiding, spying)?

---

## 19. Abandoned Copper Mine

**(Type: Resource Site / Ruin)**

*   **Location:** Likely in foothills of the [[Djew]] mountains or rocky desert regions where copper ore (malachite, azurite) is found.
*   **Appearance:** Entrance shaft(s) leading into excavated tunnels, often reinforced with wooden beams (many likely collapsed). Piles of tailings near the entrance. Discarded tools (hammer stones, bronze chisels), pottery fragments, possibly remnants of worker shelters. Tunnels are dark, dusty, and potentially unstable. Might intersect with natural caves or even Precursor tunnels.
*   **Inhabitants:** Cave creatures (bats, giant insects, [[Desert Scorpion (Serqet's Sting)|scorpions]]). Possibly occupied by [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]], fugitives, or monstrous creatures that have moved in. Ghosts of miners might haunt deeper sections.
*   **Significance:** Represents Khemri resource extraction efforts for vital metals like copper (used in bronze). Abandonment suggests depletion, disaster (collapse, flooding, creature attack), or economic shifts. Offers potential for finding leftover ore, forgotten tools, or access to deeper underground areas.
*   **Known Dangers:** Tunnel collapses, pitfalls, bad air in deeper sections, getting lost, encounters with hostile occupants (creatures or humanoids), potential for flash floods in lower levels.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   Why was the mine abandoned? What specific event occurred?
    *   Are there still rich veins of copper deeper within?
    *   Do the tunnels connect to anything unexpected (natural cave systems, Precursor tunnels [[Elder One Tunnel Network Entrance]], underground waterways)?
    *   Are there historical records or ghost stories associated with the mine's operation or abandonment?
    *   Could the mine be cleared and reactivated if resources were invested?

## 20. Field of Pillars (Elder One Boundary Markers?)

**(Type: Precursor Landmark / Anomaly Zone)**

*   **Location:** A flat, open area, perhaps a high plateau [[High Desert Plateau]] or a section of desert floor strangely devoid of dunes [[The Whispering Sands]]. Could also be submerged shallowly.
*   **Appearance:** A large expanse dominated by numerous freestanding pillars of smooth, black, non-reflective material (similar to [[Elder One Resonance Stone|Resonance Stones]]). Pillars are often perfectly cylindrical or possess unnerving geometric regularity. Spacing might follow complex, non-obvious patterns. The air between the pillars feels 'wrong' – sounds dampen, shadows behave strangely, sense of direction is confused.
*   **Inhabitants:** Usually devoid of normal life. Might contain [[Geometer's Echo|Geometer's Echoes]] or attract creatures sensitive to dimensional instability. [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]] might study the field from a distance.
*   **Significance:** Purpose unknown. Theories include: boundary markers for an Elder One domain, components of a massive energy grid or device, navigational aids based on non-Euclidean principles, or stabilizers for local reality. The field itself might be a gateway or thin spot between dimensions.
*   **Known Dangers:** Intense psychological distress [[Psychic Resistance/Sensitivity]], spatial disorientation (easy to get lost, distances distort), potential for attracting hostile entities, risk of accidentally activating the field's function (energy discharge, dimensional shift), pillars might emit harmful resonance if disturbed.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   What do the pillars mark or contain? What happens if one crosses the boundary defined by them?
    *   Do the patterns in their placement have meaning (mathematical, astronomical, dimensional)?
    *   Can the field be navigated safely using specific knowledge or artifacts ([[Shard of Impossible Geometry]])?
    *   Are there central pillars or structures within the field that control its function?
    *   Does the field change based on time, celestial alignments, or psychic conditions?

## 21. The Salt Flats of Despair

**(Type: Natural Landmark / Hazard Zone)**

*   **Location:** A vast, extremely arid basin deep within [[The Whispering Sands]] or [[Badlands]], far from the river. Possibly a dried-up ancient lakebed.
*   **Appearance:** An immense, flat expanse covered in cracked, sun-baked salt crust. Blindingly white under the sun. Mirages are common and deceptive. No vegetation, no shade. Scattered bones of creatures that perished here might be visible, preserved by the salt. Air is incredibly dry.
*   **Inhabitants:** Almost none. Salt-resistant insects or microorganisms perhaps. [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] or desperate travelers might attempt to cross, rarely successfully. Legends speak of salt elementals or spirits of those who died of thirst.
*   **Significance:** Represents the extreme hostility of the deep desert environment. A major natural barrier to travel. Salt harvested from the edges might be traded, but venturing deep is suicidal for most.
*   **Known Dangers:** Extreme heat and dehydration, lack of water, blinding glare, deceptive mirages leading travelers astray, getting lost due to lack of landmarks, cracked salt crust might hide unstable mud beneath. Psychological despair from the oppressive environment.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   Are there ruins or Precursor structures hidden beneath the salt crust?
    *   Do strange minerals or crystals form within the salt deposits?
    *   Are the legends of salt spirits true? What triggers their appearance?
    *   Could a path across the flats be found using specific knowledge or Precursor navigation aids?
    *   What secrets lie at the center of the flats, if anything could survive there?

## 22. Papyrus Mill Village (Djertyu)

**(Type: Khemri Settlement / Industrial Site)**

*   **Location:** Situated directly beside extensive papyrus swamps [[Papyrus Swamp]] along [[The Great River Arat]] or a major tributary.
*   **Appearance:** Village of mudbrick houses dominated by large open areas and sheds dedicated to processing papyrus reeds. Bundles of harvested reeds, soaking vats, pressing areas with mallets, and drying racks are visible. The air smells damp and slightly sweet from the reeds. Likely has small docks for reed-gathering boats.
*   **Inhabitants:** [[Laborers & Servants|Papyrus harvesters and processors]], [[Scribes]] (valuing proximity to the source), overseers, local village elders, perhaps merchants specializing in papyrus trade. Families of the workers.
*   **Significance:** Center of production for Khemri's primary writing material. Vital for the kingdom's administration, religious documentation, and intellectual life (such as it is). Control of papyrus production is economically important.
*   **Known Dangers:** Hazards associated with swamp harvesting (crocodiles [[River Crocodile (Meseh)]], hippos [[Hippopotamus (Deb)]], disease [[Mire Serpent (Neheb-ka)|mire serpents]]). Potential labor disputes or exploitation by overseers. Risk of fire spreading rapidly through dried reeds and workshops.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   Are specific techniques used here that produce higher quality (or magically resonant) papyrus?
    *   Do workers have unique knowledge of the swamps, including hidden paths or dangers?
    *   Could sabotage of the mill cripple Khemri bureaucracy or a specific temple's record-keeping?
    *   Are rare types of papyrus (e.g., from mutated reeds near Precursor sites) processed here secretly?
    *   Might hold clues related to the transport and trade of papyrus throughout Khemri.

## 23. The Oracle of Ur-Ghul's Cavern

**(Type: Minor Religious Site / Mystery Location)**

*   **Location:** A hidden cavern system, perhaps accessible only at night or during specific celestial events, associated with [[Ur-Ghul (The Star-Shepherd)]]. Could be in the mountains [[Djew]] or beneath the desert [[The Whispering Sands]].
*   **Appearance:** Natural caverns, possibly featuring phosphorescent minerals or fungi that mimic starlight. Central chamber might contain a deep fissure, a pool reflecting the sky (even underground?), or strange crystal formations. Atmosphere is cool, silent, and unnerving. Symbols of Ur-Ghul are prevalent.
*   **Inhabitants:** Possibly a lone priest/priestess acting as Oracle, bound spirits of the dead, or creatures associated with night and stars [[Amulet of Ur-Ghul's Guidance]]. Might be guarded by traps or illusions.
*   **Significance:** A place where devotees seek cryptic prophecies or guidance from Ur-Ghul, often related to fate, death, the future, or navigating darkness (literal or metaphorical). Access is likely restricted or requires specific offerings/rituals.
*   **Known Dangers:** Getting lost in the caverns, natural hazards (pitfalls, bad air), potentially hostile guardians (spirit or creature), receiving maddening or dangerous prophecies, attracting attention from mainstream priesthoods who view Ur-Ghul worship with suspicion.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   Is the Oracle genuine? What is the source of their prophecies (divine insight, Precursor influence, psychic sensitivity, deception)?
    *   Do the cavern structures themselves have unusual properties (e.g., amplifying psychic signals, focusing starlight)?
    *   What specific rituals or knowledge are required to consult the Oracle?
    *   Could the cavern connect to deeper underworld passages or even [[Elder Ones]] tunnels?
    *   What price does the Oracle demand for their knowledge?

*   **Location:** Could be anywhere, often marked by unusual geological formations or remnants of large structural entrances (often collapsed or buried). Might be linked by still-detectable energy conduits.
*   **Appearance:** Remnants of a large station built with 'star-metal' and advanced composites. Features include decayed platforms, shattered transit tubes or portals, damaged control consoles, and possibly dormant power systems. Evidence of past conflict or catastrophic failure is likely. May intersect with Khemri structures built unknowingly on top.
*   **Inhabitants:** [[Star-Weaver Sentinel (Malfunctioning Automaton)|Malfunctioning sentinels]], [[Star-Weaver Phase Spider|phase spiders]], energy-based life forms, possibly creatures that have adapted to nesting within the conduits. [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]] or [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] might explore accessible sections.
*   **Significance:** Part of a network potentially spanning vast distances (regional or even planetary?), used by the [[Star-Weavers]] for rapid transport of personnel or materials. Understanding its function could reveal Star-Weaver logistics and technology. Might contain salvageable high-tech components.
*   **Known Dangers:** Structural collapse, hazardous energy leaks, active defenses, environmental hazards within damaged sections (vacuum, radiation), getting lost in complex layouts, potential for accidental activation of damaged transit systems (leading anywhere or nowhere).
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   Where did the transit network lead? Can any destinations still be accessed?
    *   What technology powered the transit system (portals, grav-tubes, teleportation)?
    *   Are there network maps or logs recoverable from the control consoles ([[Engineering (Precursor Tech)]] skill)?
    *   Did the hub's destruction contribute to the Star-Weavers' downfall or the [[Year of Skyfall]]?
    *   Could reactivating even a small part of the network provide shortcuts or access to hidden locations?

--- 

## 25. Elder One Geometric Conversion Site

**(Type: Precursor Ruin / Anomaly Zone, Elder One Origin)**

*   **Location:** Often found deep underground, accessed via [[Elder One Tunnel Network Entrance|tunnel networks]], or in areas where reality seems thin or warped. Might be marked by geometrically perfect intrusions into the natural landscape.
*   **Appearance:** A chamber or area where the natural environment (rock, earth, perhaps even fossilized organic matter) is being actively or was once actively converted into the smooth, non-Euclidean geometry characteristic of the [[Elder Ones]]. Features shifting walls, floors that curve into ceilings, and pillars of impossible angles extruding from mundane rock. May contain partially converted creatures or objects trapped within the geometry. A low, dissonant hum [[Elder One Resonance Stone]] might be present.
*   **Inhabitants:** Likely none, except perhaps [[Geometer's Echo|Geometer's Echoes]], [[Fractured Construct (Elder One Ruin Hazard)|Fractured Constructs]], or creatures driven mad [[Angler Worm (Elder One Parasite/Symbiote?)|by the environment]]. [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]] might observe from a safe distance.
*   **Significance:** Demonstrates the Elder Ones' method of construction or expansion – literally converting existing reality into their own alien framework. Offers terrifying insight into their nature and power. Studying the process might reveal weaknesses or ways to counteract their influence.
*   **Known Dangers:** Extreme spatial distortion and psychological stress [[Psychic Resistance/Sensitivity]]. Risk of being caught in the conversion process (absorbed into the geometry). Unstable reality might cause equipment malfunction or unpredictable teleportation. Encounters with entities native to or attracted by the process.
*   **Mysteries & Hooks:**
    *   What powers the conversion process? Is it still active, dormant, or cyclical?
    *   Can the process be reversed or halted?
    *   What happens to the consciousness or matter of things absorbed into the geometry?
    *   Are these sites related to the creation of [[Shard of Impossible Geometry|Shards of Impossible Geometry]]?
    *   Do these sites represent terraforming, defense mechanisms, or something else entirely?

# Discovery Encounter 6: Uncover a Hidden Water Source

*   **Encounter Name:** Find a Hidden Spring
*   **Background Story:** While traversing an arid region, possibly following faint animal tracks or specific clues from a map fragment, the expedition searches desperately for water. The heat is oppressive, and supplies are dwindling.
*   **Setting Details:** The terrain is dry and rocky, perhaps a narrow canyon or a sun-baked plain. Sparse, hardy vegetation clings to life. The air shimmers with heat.
*   **Trigger:** Exploring arid regions, following animal tracks, specific map clues. Increased chance with high *[Survival]* skill.
*   **Effect on NPC:** Notices subtle signs of water often missed: slight dampness in the soil under a rock, a patch of unusually green plants, faint seepage from a cliff face.
*   **NPC Action:** Investigate the promising signs further. *[Potential Skill Check: Survival]*
*   **Outcome:**

*   **Intrigue:** How long has this source been here? Is it known to locals or creatures? Could it support a hidden camp or habitat?
*   **Combat:** No (though the source might attract animals, potentially leading to a separate encounter).

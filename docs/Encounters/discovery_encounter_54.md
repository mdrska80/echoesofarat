# Discovery Encounter 54: Markings of Belief

*   **Encounter Name:** Ritual Tattooing Needles
*   **Background Story:** Body modification, including tattooing, has ancient roots. This encounter uncovers tools used not just for decoration, but potentially for `[[Concept: Ritualistic Tattooing]]` - marking rites of passage, tribal affiliation, magical protection, or devotion within specific Khemri subcultures or perhaps even older groups. Such practices might be common among desert nomads (`[[Nomadic Encampment (Bedouin)]]`) or within specific cults.
*   **Setting Details:** Found within a shaman's hut in a ruined tribal area, tucked away in a niche within a specific type of tomb (perhaps belonging to a tribal leader or shaman), or lost within a `[[Nomadic Encampment (Bedouin)]]` site. The needles, made of sharpened bone or bronze, might be bundled in leather or cloth, possibly alongside pots containing dried pigment residue (ochre, kohl).
*   **Trigger:** NPC searches a relevant location (shamanistic site, specific tomb type, nomad camp) with good Observation.
*   **Effect on NPC:** Finds a small bundle containing sharp needles, clearly designed for piercing skin. Dried pigment might be visible, suggesting their use for tattooing.
*   **NPC Action:** Examine the needles. *[Skill Check: Archaeology (Moderate)]* to recognize their function and potential ritual significance, or *[Skill Check: Medicine (Easy)]* to identify them simply as sharp implements, possibly noting pigment stains.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   *Success:* The NPC identifies the `[[encounters-objects/Items/Tattooing Needles]]` and understands their likely use in `[[Concept: Ritualistic Tattooing]]`. Gain minor Archaeology/Medicine XP. The item is a minor artifact hinting at specific cultural practices.
    *   *Failure:* The NPC recognizes the needles as sharp tools but may not grasp their specific cultural context.
*   **Intrigue:** Which groups practiced ritual tattooing? What did the tattoos signify? Does this practice continue among any Khemri groups? Are the pigments locally sourced or indicative of trade?
*   **Combat:** No.
*   **Skill Learned:** Minor Archaeology XP or Medicine XP.
*   **Item Received:** `[[encounters-objects/Items/Tattooing Needles]]` (Minor Artifact).

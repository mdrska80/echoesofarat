# Discovery Encounter 61: The Whispering Geode

*   **Encounter Name:** The Whispering Geode
*   **Background Story:** While geodes are natural formations, sometimes strange energies or materials from past epochs, particularly the [[encounters-objects/Civilizations/Star-Weavers]], become embedded within them. These energies might manifest subtly to those sensitive or close enough.
*   **Setting Details:** Found amongst ordinary rocks in a rocky wadi, a desert plateau, or perhaps unearthed near precursor ruins. Externally, it looks like a normal, rough geode, perhaps slightly larger than average or with unusual coloration streaks.
*   **Trigger:** NPC explores rocky terrain or searches ruins. An *[Skill Check: Observation (Moderate)]* might be required to notice it among mundane rocks unless the NPC gets very close.
*   **Effect on NPC:** The NPC notices a faint, almost inaudible hum or vibration emanating from a specific geode when nearby. The feeling is strange and unnatural.
*   **NPC Action:** Examine the geode. The NPC might try to crack it open using tools *[Item Check: Hammer Stone or similar required]*. *[Skill Check: Observation (Easy)]* upon getting close to confirm the humming is from the geode.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   *Success (Opened):* The geode cracks open revealing not typical crystals, but a smooth, metallic-looking interior surface that seems to absorb light, perhaps with faint, pulsing geometric patterns. The humming intensifies slightly before fading. The NPC acquires `[[encounters-objects/Items/Whispering Geode Fragment]]`. Gain minor Observation XP.
    *   *Partial Success (Not Opened/Observed):* The NPC confirms the strange humming comes from the geode but lacks the tools or fails to open it. The location could be marked. Gain minor Observation XP.
    *   *Failure (Not Noticed):* The NPC overlooks the geode entirely.
*   **Intrigue:** What is the source of the hum? What is the strange material inside? Is it related to the [[encounters-objects/Civilizations/Star-Weavers]] energy sources mentioned in [[lore.md]]? Could other, similar objects be found nearby?
*   **Combat:** No.
*   **Skill Learned:** Minor Observation XP.
*   **Item Received:** `[[encounters-objects/Items/Whispering Geode Fragment]]` (if opened).
*   **Player Interaction Point:** No.
*   **Lore Introduced:**
    *   `[[encounters-objects/Items/Whispering Geode Fragment]]`
    *   Hints at [[encounters-objects/Civilizations/Star-Weavers]] presence/technology remnants in unexpected places.
    *   Connects to the concept of latent Precursor energies.

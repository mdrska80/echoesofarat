# Discovery Encounter 3: Elder Sign Geode

*   **Encounter Name:** Find an Elder Sign Geode
*   **Background Story:** Crossing the howling expanse near Dustfall Outpost, the expedition notices the ruins seem built upon even older, cyclopean foundations barely visible beneath the Khemri structures. Rumors claim tunnels lead deep below. The Scholar NPC searches for any artifacts distinctly *unlike* Khemri or even Star-Weaver remains.
*   **Setting Details:** The wind carries abrasive sand that scours exposed surfaces. In the lee of a massive, fused-black stone block (clearly not Khemri sandstone), the ground feels oddly stable, vibration-dampened. A geode, cracked open, lies here, its exterior mundane but its interior facets reflecting light in impossible, dizzying ways.
*   **Trigger:** Finding the geode with non-Euclidean internal facets.
*   **Effect on NPC:** Gazing into the geode induces vertigo and a brief, unsettling glimpse of vast, alien geometries. The crystal facets seem to shift and refuse to resolve into stable shapes. The air around it feels cold.
*   **NPC Action:** Averts gaze quickly. Picks up the geode using cloth to avoid direct contact. *[Potential Check: Willpower or Lore (Precursors) check to handle it without lingering nausea/disorientation]*. Stores it wrapped, away from other items.
*   **Outcome:** Acquires 'Elder Sign Geode'. A dangerous curiosity. Represents a direct link to the Elder Ones and their reality-warping nature.
*   **Intrigue:** How did this Elder One artifact reach the surface? Was it unearthed by geological shifts exposing deep tunnels, or brought up by something else? Does its presence confirm the rumors of deep passages beneath Dustfall? What power might it hold, and at what cost?
*   **Combat:** No.
*   **Skill Learned:** Potential minor Lore (Precursors) XP.
*   **Item Received:** 'Elder Sign Geode' (Unique Artifact, Hazardous, Precursor Clue).
*   **Player Interaction Point:** No.

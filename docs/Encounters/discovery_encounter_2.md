# Discovery Encounter 2: Pot Sealed with Chrono-Resin

*   **Encounter Name:** Discover a Pot Sealed with Chrono-Resin
*   **Background Story:** Driven into the ruins of the Village of Lost Whispers by a sudden, unnatural dust storm that seemed to age metal rapidly, the expedition seeks shelter. The oppressive silence within a collapsed storehouse feels wrong, punctuated by moments where sounds seem to echo slightly *before* they happen.
*   **Setting Details:** Dust coats everything in a thick, ochre layer. Shadows flicker strangely, unstuck from the objects casting them. A sturdy pot sits intact, sealed with a glassy, amber-colored resin. Faint, ghostly images seem to momentarily flicker within the resin itself.
*   **Trigger:** Locating the pot with the flickering, time-distorted resin seal.
*   **Effect on NPC:** The resin feels neither warm nor cold, but seems to induce a brief moment of temporal disorientation (a flash of the pot being sealed, or crumbling to dust). The flickering images within are disturbing.
*   **NPC Action:** Attempts to chip away the seal. The tool seems to pass through the flickering images with no resistance, but the resin itself is incredibly hard. *[Potential Check: Requires specialized tool? High Labor skill? Risk of temporal backlash?]* Smashing might cause unpredictable effects.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   *Seal Broken (Contents Intact?):* Inside are dried fruits unknown to Khemri, seemingly caught mid-decay. They flicker between preserved and dust. Identified as 'Temporal Fruit Samples'. Unstable. Added to inventory.
    *   *Seal Broken (Contents Decayed):* The fruit instantly collapses into fine grey dust, leaving only geometric seeds that also seem to phase slightly.
    *   *Pot Smashed / Backlash:* Smashing the pot might trigger a localized time loop or rapid aging/de-aging effect on the NPC or nearby items.
*   **Intrigue:** This resin seems Chronomancer in origin. Are the temporal effects a preservation method or a side effect? Was the 'Dust Fever' plague actually a temporal sickness? Are the whispers locals fear echoes from the past/future trapped by Chronomancer activity? What lies deeper beneath this village?
*   **Combat:** No (but temporal effects can be hazardous).
*   **Skill Learned:** No.
*   **Item Received:** 'Temporal Fruit Samples' or 'Phasing Geometric Seeds' (likely, if seal broken safely), or 'Chrono-Resin Fragment' (potentially hazardous).
*   **Player Interaction Point:** Yes. Player asked: "Attempt to carefully break the unsettling Chrono-Resin seal (Risky, Unknown Tool Needed?) or Smash the pot and stand back (Unpredictable Consequences)?"
*   **Lore Introduced:**
    *   Village of Lost Whispers is associated with the 'Dust Fever' and temporal distortions (flickering shadows, sound echoes). ([Lore Entry](lore.md#known-locations--regions))
    *   Chronomancer artifacts can include hard, glassy resins that trap temporal echoes or cause disorientation. ([Lore Entry](lore.md#precursor-civilizations))
    *   Chronomancer influence can cause items to flicker in time or decay instantly upon interaction. ([Lore Entry](lore.md#precursor-civilizations))
    *   Attempting to interact with Chronomancer tech can have hazardous temporal side effects (loops, aging). ([Lore Entry](lore.md#precursor-civilizations))
    *   Star-Weaver seeds are geometrically distinct. ([Lore Entry](lore.md#precursor-civilizations))

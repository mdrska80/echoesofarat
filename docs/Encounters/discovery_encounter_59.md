# Discovery Encounter 59: Potter's Prize

*   **Encounter Name:** Fine Clay Deposit
*   **Background Story:** High-quality clay is essential for durable and fine pottery, a key craft in Khemri. Certain locations, often near riverbeds or specific geological formations, yield clay with superior texture and fewer impurities, making them valuable resource sites.
*   **Setting Details:** An exposed riverbank (`[[The Great River Arat]]`) revealing a distinct layer of smooth, fine-grained clay, different from the surrounding soil. Could also be a natural deposit found in a specific type of geological area (e.g., ancient lake bed).
*   **Trigger:** NPC explores near riverbeds or known geological areas suitable for clay deposits. Success chance increased by Survival or Crafting Lore skill.
*   **Effect on NPC:** Notices an exposed deposit of clay that looks unusually smooth and pure in texture.
*   **NPC Action:** Examine the clay, testing its texture and plasticity. *[Skill Check: Survival (Easy)]* or *[Skill Check: Crafting Lore (Pottery - Moderate)]* to confirm its quality.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   *Success:* NPC identifies the deposit as `[[encounters-objects/Resources/Fine Clay]]`, a valuable resource. Gain minor Survival or Crafting Lore XP. Clay can be gathered (if mechanics allow, likely heavy/bulky) or the location marked for potential exploitation or trade information.
    *   *Failure:* NPC recognizes it as clay but doesn't appreciate its exceptional quality.
*   **Intrigue:** Is this deposit known locally? Could it support a pottery workshop? Are there other mineral resources nearby?
*   **Combat:** No.
*   **Skill Learned:** Minor Survival XP or Crafting Lore XP.
*   **Item Received:** `[[encounters-objects/Resources/Fine Clay]]` (Resource, if gathered).

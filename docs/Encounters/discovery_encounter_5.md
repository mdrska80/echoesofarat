# Discovery Encounter 5: Resonating Sun Amulet

*   **Encounter Name:** Find a Resonating Sun Amulet
*   **Background Story:** Following a perplexing star-chart fragment (part Khemri glyphs sacred to Ur-Ghul, part unreadable Star-Weaver notation?), the expedition seeks Warden Iymeru's tomb in the Province of Whispering Sands. The chart leads them not to a Khemri necropolis, but to a single, anomalous tomb entrance set into smooth, fused rock that seems far older than Khemri work – possibly Elder One or Star-Weaver construction.
*   **Setting Details:** The air near the entrance hums faintly. The rock feels warm despite the relentless sun. Tracks indicate others have been here – the Seekers of the Veiled Path? Near the entrance, nestled in the sand, lies an amulet reflecting sunlight with an oily sheen.
*   **Trigger:** Spotting the unusually reflective amulet near the anomalous tomb entrance.
*   **Effect on NPC:** The amulet depicts A'shar's winged sun disk but is crafted from warm, lightweight 'star-metal'. As the NPC approaches, it pulses with faint warmth and emits a barely audible, complex series of tones – as if reacting to their presence or the nearby tomb.
*   **NPC Action:** Picks up the amulet. The warmth and resonating tones intensify slightly. No visible Khemri inscriptions, but microscopic examination might reveal Star-Weaver data-glyphs.
*   **Outcome:** Acquires 'Resonating Sun Amulet'. A unique blend of Khemri iconography and active Star-Weaver technology.
*   **Intrigue:** Why is a Khemri symbol on an active Star-Weaver artifact? Is the amulet a key to this strange tomb? Was Iymeru not Khemri, but a Star-Weaver survivor, or someone deeply involved with their legacy? Or did the Seekers drop this device used to locate/interact with the tomb? Could the star-chart itself be a Star-Weaver map fragment?
*   **Combat:** No.
*   **Skill Learned:** No.
*   **Item Received:** 'Resonating Sun Amulet' (Unique Artifact, Active Precursor Tech, Quest Key?).
*   **Player Interaction Point:** No.
*   **Lore Introduced:**
    *   Some Khemri star-charts might incorporate partial Star-Weaver data. ([Lore Entry](lore.md#precursor-civilizations))
    *   Precursor sites (Elder One / Star-Weaver) might be hidden within or connected to Khemri provinces like the Whispering Sands. ([Lore Entry](lore.md#known-locations--regions))
    *   Seekers of the Veiled Path actively search for Precursor sites. ([Lore Entry](lore.md#factions--peoples))
    *   A'shar's symbol is a winged sun disk. ([Lore Entry](lore.md#khemri-pantheon))
    *   Star-metal can be warm, light, and have an oily sheen. ([Lore Entry](lore.md#precursor-civilizations))
    *   Some Star-Weaver artifacts might still be active, emitting energy, heat, or complex tones, potentially reacting to proximity or serving as keys. ([Lore Entry](lore.md#precursor-civilizations))

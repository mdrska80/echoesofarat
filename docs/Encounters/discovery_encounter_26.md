# Discovery Encounter 26: Discover a Beehive

*   **Encounter Name:** Honey Find
*   **Background Story:** While exploring areas with more abundant vegetation or near rocky clefts, the NPC hears buzzing or spots [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Bees|Bees]] entering/leaving a specific location.
*   **Setting Details:** Could be a hollow in a tree, a crevice in rocks, or even inside a large abandoned pot or ruin cavity.
*   **Trigger:** Exploring areas with flowering plants, trees, rocky clefts. *[Survival]* skill increases chance.
*   **Effect on NPC:** Locates an active beehive. Potential resource, but also clear danger from the [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Bees|Bees]].
*   **NPC Action:** Assess the hive. *[Potential Choice/Skill Check: Attempt to smoke out [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Bees|bees]] (Requires specific items/tools & *[Survival]* skill) or Leave it alone]*. Failure in harvesting risks provoking a swarm.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   *Success (Harvest):* Obtains [[encounters-objects/Items/Honey|Honey]] (valuable food/trade good) and [[encounters-objects/Items/Beeswax|Beeswax]] (crafting/trade good). Minor *[Survival]* XP. Risk of some stings even on success (minor Health/Stamina penalty).
    *   *Failure (Harvest):* Agitates [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Bees|bees]], triggers Hazard encounter (Swarm of Angry [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Bees|Bees]]). No items gained.
    *   *Leave alone:* No items gained, no immediate risk.
*   **Intrigue:** How long have the bees been here? Is this hive regularly harvested by locals?
*   **Combat:** No, but failure leads to a Hazard encounter.
*   **Skill Learned:** Minor *[Survival]* XP on successful harvest.
*   **Item Received:** [[encounters-objects/Items/Honey|Honey]], [[encounters-objects/Items/Beeswax|Beeswax]] (on success).
*   **Player Interaction Point:** Yes (Likely). Player asked: "Attempt to harvest the beehive (Requires Survival/Tools, Risky) or Leave it alone?".
*   **Lore Introduced:**
    *   [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Bees|Bees]] produce valuable [[encounters-objects/Items/Honey|Honey]] and [[encounters-objects/Items/Beeswax|Beeswax]]. \[[lore.md]]
    *   Harvesting requires skill and carries risk. \[[lore.md]]

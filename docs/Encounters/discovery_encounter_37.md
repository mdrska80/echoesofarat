# Discovery Encounter 37: Locate Meteorite Fragment

*   **Encounter Name:** Iron from the Sky
*   **Background Story:** While exploring remote deep desert regions or areas rumored to be ancient impact sites, the NPC finds a peculiar rock unlike the surrounding geology.
*   **Setting Details:** A dark, unusually heavy rock, perhaps partially buried, showing signs of melting or a distinct fusion crust. Could be sitting incongruously on sand or embedded in older rock.
*   **Trigger:** Exploring deep desert, impact sites (if known). Extremely rare random event.

Highly valuable material, potentially for crafting unique tools/weapons or as a major trade good/offering. Added to inventory (heavy). Significant *[Observation]*/*[Archaeology]* XP.
*   **Intrigue:** Is this related to the legends of the 'Year of Skyfall'? Could it be used to forge superior items? Are there more fragments nearby?

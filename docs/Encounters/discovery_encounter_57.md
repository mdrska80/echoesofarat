# Discovery Encounter 57: Slither's Sign

*   **Encounter Name:** Large Shed Snake Skin
*   **Background Story:** The deserts and riverbanks of Khemri are home to numerous reptiles, including large snakes. Finding a shed skin is a clear indication that such creatures inhabit the area, serving as both a point of interest and a potential warning.
*   **Setting Details:** Found draped over rocks, caught in thorny bushes, lying on the floor of a cave, or near a water source (`[[The Great River Arat]]`, `[[Khenet Oasis]]`). The skin is dry, possibly brittle, but largely complete, showing the scale pattern and impressive size of its former owner.
*   **Trigger:** NPC explores a location suitable for large snakes (caves, ruins, rocky areas, near water).
*   **Effect on NPC:** Finds the complete, shed skin of a notably large snake.
*   **NPC Action:** Examine the skin. *[Skill Check: Survival (Easy)]* to estimate the size and potential type of snake (e.g., 'Large constrictor', 'Venomous viper type').
*   **Outcome:**
    *   *Success:* NPC gains minor Survival XP and correctly assesses the potential danger associated with the snake type. The skin itself (`[[encounters-objects/Items/Shed Snake Skin]]`) is collected as a misc item or potential crafting component (e.g., for decoration, leatherwork if applicable).
    *   *Failure:* NPC finds the skin but doesn't learn much, perhaps underestimating the size/danger. Skin is still collected.
*   **Intrigue:** How large was the snake exactly? Is it still nearby? Are these snakes common in this region, or is this unusual?
*   **Combat:** No.
*   **Skill Learned:** Minor Survival XP.
*   **Item Received:** `[[encounters-objects/Items/Shed Snake Skin]]` (Misc Item/Crafting).
*   **Player Interaction Point:** No.
*   **Lore Introduced:**
    *   Highlights presence of large reptiles in the environment.
    *   Introduces `[[encounters-objects/Items/Shed Snake Skin]]` as an item.

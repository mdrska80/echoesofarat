# Discovery Encounter 24: Find Abandoned Shaduf

*   **Encounter Name:** Broken Water-Lifter
*   **Background Story:** While exploring areas near current or ancient farmland, river banks, or canals, the NPC comes across a large wooden structure clearly intended for lifting water.
*   **Setting Details:** The [[encounters-objects/Items/Shaduf|Shaduf]] stands partially collapsed near a waterway, its wood weathered and grey, possibly missing the bucket or counterweight.
*   **Trigger:** Exploring near current or ancient farmland, river banks, canals.
*   **Effect on NPC:** Finds the wooden framework of a [[encounters-objects/Items/Shaduf|Shaduf]], incomplete or fallen into disrepair.

# Discovery Encounter 50: Modern Dangers

*   **Encounter Name:** Rival Traps Detected
*   **Background Story:** Not all dangers in the ruins are ancient. Other groups, perhaps [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]], rival [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]], or unknown tomb robbers (`[[Rivals]]` - placeholder concept), are also exploring these dangerous places. They may leave behind their own hazards, either to protect their finds or hinder competitors.
*   **Setting Details:** Within a tomb passage, ruin interior, or strategically important choke point (e.g., narrow canyon approach). Subtle signs are present: unnaturally disturbed dust patterns, a thin wire almost invisible near the floor, fresh scrape marks on stone, or a mechanism partially hidden in shadow that doesn't match the surrounding architecture's age or style.
*   **Trigger:** NPC explores an area known for tombs or valuable ruins, possibly while tracking signs of recent passage. Requires a successful *[Skill Check: Observation (High)]* or *[Skill Check: Survival (Traps - Moderate)]* to spot the subtle signs.
*   **Effect on NPC:** The NPC freezes, noticing something out of place - a recently set trap, more sophisticated or cruder than expected ancient mechanisms. A wave of caution; the realization that they are not alone or that recent visitors were hostile.
*   **NPC Action:** Carefully examine the detected trap mechanism without triggering it. *[Skill Check: Survival (Traps - High)]* to understand its function and potential disarming method, or *[Skill Check: Observation (Moderate)]* just to identify the danger zone.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   *Success (Identify):* The NPC recognizes the trap as modern/recently set by rivals. Gains Survival/Observation XP. They now know skilled adversaries are nearby or have passed through recently, increasing tension.
    *   *Success (Understand/Disarm - Requires High Skill & possibly Tools):* The NPC understands the trap mechanism well enough to potentially disarm it (risky action, could trigger failure outcome if failed). If successful, might salvage `[[Trap Components]]` (placeholder item). Significant Survival (Traps) XP.
    *   *Failure (Spotting):* Encounter doesn't trigger; NPC might blunder into the trap later (leading to a Hazard encounter).
    *   *Failure (Disarm):* The NPC triggers the trap while attempting to disarm it (leading to Hazard encounter).
*   **Intrigue:** Who set this trap? Are they still nearby? What are they protecting or who are they trying to stop? Is this related to the [[lore.md#Mysteries & Legends|mysteries]] of the area?
*   **Combat:** No, but strongly indicates immediate risk of combat or further traps.
*   **Skill Learned:** Survival (Traps) XP, Observation XP.
*   **Item Received:** Potentially `[[Trap Components]]` if successfully disarmed.
*   **Player Interaction Point:** No (NPC likely defaults to avoiding the trap unless specifically skilled/equipped for disarming and player has set aggressive tactics).
*   **Lore Introduced:**
    *   Concept of active `[[Rivals]]` exploring the same areas.
    *   Existence of modern `[[Rival Traps]]` alongside ancient hazards.
    *   Reinforces the dangers of exploration beyond just environmental or ancient threats.

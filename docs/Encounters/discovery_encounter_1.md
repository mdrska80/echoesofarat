# Discovery Encounter 1: Pouch with Shifting Seal

*   **Encounter Name:** Find a Pouch with a Shifting Seal
*   **Background Story:** Following a dangerous track toward [[Khenet Oasis]], the expedition detours around the [[Serpent's Tooth]] rocks, notorious haunt of the [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]]. Near the base, they find signs of a violent encounter: churned sand, strange viscous residue that sizzles faintly on the hot rock, and chitinous fragments unlike any known local creature. The air carries an acrid, ozone-like smell.
*   **Setting Details:** The jagged black rocks cast long, distorted shadows. The viscous residue seems to absorb light. Amongst the debris lies a slashed waterskin made of resilient, non-animal hide and a peculiar pouch, half-buried.
*   **Trigger:** Finding the [[encounters-objects/Items/Pouch with Shifting Seal]] amidst the evidence of the strange conflict.
*   **Effect on NPC:** The pouch is made of a slick, dark material that feels unnaturally cool. The metallic coil sealing it subtly *shifts* as if rearranging itself, briefly resembling a serpent ([[Nefet]]'s symbol?) before resolving into complex, non-Khemri geometric patterns. It hums with a barely contained energy.
*   **NPC Action:** Hesitantly touches the shifting seal. It clicks open, revealing the contents.
*   **Outcome:** Finds a handful of polished Copper Shards, unnaturally pure and perfectly identical. Added to NPC inventory as '[[encounters-objects/Items/Pouch with Shifting Seal]]'. The pouch itself feels like it might have other functions.
*   **Intrigue:** The shifting seal suggests [[encounters-objects/Civilizations/Star-Weavers]] or even [[encounters-objects/Civilizations/Chronomancers]] tech, mimicking Khemri symbols. The viscous residue and chitinous fragments point to a non-Khemri creature. What attacked the pouch's owner? Was it drawn by the pouch's energy? Were the [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] involved, or did they stumble upon the aftermath? Could this pouch be a key or control device?
*   **Combat:** No.
*   **Skill Learned:** No.
*   **Item Received:** [[encounters-objects/Items/Pouch with Shifting Seal]] (Unique Artifact, Precursor Tech hint, Quest flag).
*   **Player Interaction Point:** No.

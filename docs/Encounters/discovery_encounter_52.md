# Discovery Encounter 52: Buried Arsenal

*   **Encounter Name:** Cache of Spearheads
*   **Background Story:** Warfare and conflict have been constants throughout Khemri history and likely during the [[Epochs|Precursor Epochs]] as well. This encounter represents finding a forgotten stash of basic weaponry, perhaps buried hastily by soldiers before a battle, hidden in an old guard post, or simply lost in the collapse of an armory.
*   **Setting Details:** Within the dusty ruins of a military outpost, guard tower, or armory building. Alternatively, buried shallowly near a known ancient battlefield or chokepoint. The NPC might notice disturbed earth or a corner of a rotten wooden box/leather bundle sticking out.
*   **Trigger:** NPC searches likely locations (armories, guard posts) or spots signs of a buried cache while exploring former conflict zones.
*   **Effect on NPC:** Unearths a bundle or container holding multiple spearheads made of bronze.
*   **NPC Action:** Examine the spearheads. Check their condition (most should be usable, perhaps slightly tarnished). Assess quantity.
*   **Outcome:** The NPC recovers a cache of simple `[[encounters-objects/Items/Bronze Spearheads]]`. These are functional and can be added to the inventory. They represent a valuable resource, either for crafting into `[[Spears]]` (if applicable) or as trade goods.
*   **Intrigue:** Who left these here? Was it recent Khemri soldiers or someone older? What battle were they preparing for?
*   **Combat:** No.
*   **Skill Learned:** No.
*   **Item Received:** `[[encounters-objects/Items/Bronze Spearheads]]` (Resource/Trade Good, quantity based on cache size).
*   **Player Interaction Point:** No.
*   **Lore Introduced:**
    *   Reinforces the presence of past conflicts.
    *   Introduces `[[encounters-objects/Items/Bronze Spearheads]]` as a resource/item.

# Discovery Encounter 51: Preserved by Time

*   **Encounter Name:** Naturally Mummified Sacred Animal
*   **Background Story:** The extremely dry conditions within certain sealed tombs or deep caves, particularly those used as a `[[encounters-objects/Locations/Sacred Animal Necropolis]]`, can naturally preserve organic matter. This encounter involves finding the remains of an animal held sacred by the [[Khemri People]], such as a cat (associated perhaps with Bastet analogues or protection) or an Ibis (linked to Thoth analogues or [[Ur-Ghul]] in his wisdom aspect), preserved not by deliberate mummification but by the environment itself.
*   **Setting Details:** Deep within a dry cave system, a sealed chamber of a minor tomb, or specifically within a known (or newly discovered) `[[encounters-objects/Locations/Sacred Animal Necropolis]]`. The air is exceptionally dry and still. The desiccated remains of a cat or ibis lie undisturbed, perhaps partially covered in dust, looking almost lifelike despite its age.
*   **Trigger:** NPC explores a location fitting the description (dry cave, sealed tomb, animal necropolis).
*   **Effect on NPC:** Finds the perfectly preserved remains of a [[encounters-objects/Concepts/Sacred Animal|Sacred Animal]]. Depending on the NPC's background (e.g., [[NPC:Priest Pasher]]), they might react with reverence or caution. Others might see it primarily as an archaeological curiosity.
*   **NPC Action:** Examine the remains respectfully. *[Skill Check: Archaeology (Easy)]* to note the natural preservation, or *[Skill Check: Medicine (Easy)]* to assess the state of preservation.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   *Success:* The NPC identifies the creature and notes its remarkable preservation. Minor Archaeology or Medicine XP gain. The remains are recognized as potentially significant or a `[[encounters-objects/Concepts/Sacred Object]]`.
    *   *Failure:* The NPC finds the remains but doesn't grasp the full significance of the natural mummification.
*   **Intrigue:** Why was this animal here? Was it a pet, an offering, or simply seeking shelter? Does its presence signify anything about this specific location? How does natural preservation differ from intentional mummification?
*   **Combat:** No.
*   **Skill Learned:** Minor Archaeology XP or Medicine XP.
*   **Item Received:** `[[encounters-objects/Items/Natural Mummy (Cat or Ibis)]]` (Minor Artifact).
*   **Player Interaction Point:** No.

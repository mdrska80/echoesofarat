# Discovery Encounter 55: Hermit's Ledge

*   **Encounter Name:** Hidden Supply Cache
*   **Background Story:** Travelers, hermits, or scouts sometimes create small, hidden caches of supplies along difficult routes or near remote observation points. This encounter involves finding such a stash, likely left by someone familiar with the area who intended to return.
*   **Setting Details:** A narrow, hard-to-reach ledge high on a cliff face, accessible only via climbing, or perhaps tucked away in the upper levels of tall ruins. The cache might be a simple bundle wrapped in cloth or leather, or items placed within a natural crevice, sheltered from the elements.
*   **Trigger:** NPC with good Observation skill is climbing a rock face or exploring high sections of ruins. May also require an Agility or Climbing skill check to reach the location.
*   **Effect on NPC:** Spots a small bundle or collection of items tucked away on a ledge or in a crevice.
*   **NPC Action:** Carefully retrieve and examine the contents of the cache.
*   **Outcome:** The NPC finds a small stash, likely containing `[[encounters-objects/Items/Dried Herbs]]` (potentially `[[Medicinal Herbs (Basic)]]` or just common herbs), possibly some `[[Dried Fish (Ration)]]` or `[[Flatbread (Ration)]]`, and maybe a very basic tool like a `[[Flint Dagger]]` or `[[Hammer Stone]]`. Items are added to inventory. Gain minor Observation or Survival XP.
*   **Intrigue:** Who left this cache? Were they a hermit, a scout, or someone else? Why didn't they return for it? Does the type of herb indicate specialized knowledge?
*   **Combat:** No.
*   **Skill Learned:** Minor Observation XP or Survival XP.
*   **Item Received:** `[[encounters-objects/Items/Dried Herbs]]`, potentially other minor supplies/tools.
*   **Player Interaction Point:** No.
*   **Lore Introduced:**
    *   Hints at the presence of hermits or scouts in remote areas.
    *   Introduces `[[encounters-objects/Items/Dried Herbs]]` as a potential find.

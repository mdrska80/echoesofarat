# Discovery Encounter 15: Discover a Faint Path Leading Off-Trail

*   **Encounter Name:** Hidden Trail
*   **Background Story:** While following a known route or traversing wilderness, the NPC notices subtle signs that someone or something regularly diverges from the main path here.
*   **Setting Details:** Could be through dense scrubland, across a rocky plateau, or winding away from a main track into less-explored ruins or canyons. Marked by slightly disturbed ground, broken twigs, displaced rocks.
*   **Trigger:** Traveling through wilderness, scrubland, less-traveled parts of ruins.
*   **Effect on NPC:** Notices subtle signs of passage diverging from the main route (broken twigs, faint footprints, cleared rocks).
*   **NPC Action:** Observe the path. *[Potential Skill Check: Survival or Observation]*
*   **Outcome:**
    *   *Success:* Recognizes it as a deliberately used path, not just random animal movement. It might lead towards a hidden location (camp, shrine, resource), serve as a shortcut, or potentially lead into danger (ambush spot, predator lair). Gain minor *[Survival]*/*[Observation]* XP. Might trigger a player choice about whether to investigate.
    *   *Failure:* Dismisses it as an insignificant animal trail or random natural disturbances.
*   **Intrigue:** Who uses this path? Where does it lead? Is it safe?
*   **Combat:** No, but the path could potentially lead towards a hazard or combat encounter.
*   **Skill Learned:** Minor *[Survival]*/*[Observation]* XP on success.
*   **Item Received:** No. Information / potential new route discovered.
*   **Player Interaction Point:** Yes (Occasionally). If the main goal/route is clear but the faint path looks potentially interesting or risky, player might be asked: "Follow the main route or Investigate the faint path?".
*   **Lore Introduced:**
    *   Hidden paths and shortcuts exist away from main routes. \[[lore.md]]

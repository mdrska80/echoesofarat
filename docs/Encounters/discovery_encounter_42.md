# Discovery Encounter 42: Find Fisherman's Net

*   **Encounter Name:** Tangled Netting
*   **Background Story:** While exploring along the banks of [[The Great River Arat]], oasis shores, or near fishing villages, the NPC finds remnants of fishing activity.
*   **Setting Details:** A discarded [[encounters-objects/Items/Fisherman's Net|Fisherman's Net]] lies snagged on reeds, caught on underwater rocks, or simply left on the bank, tangled and perhaps torn.
*   **Trigger:** Exploring riverbanks, lakeshores, fishing villages.
*   **Effect on NPC:** Finds a discarded [[encounters-objects/Items/Fisherman's Net|fishing net]], possibly snagged or torn.
*   **NPC Action:** Examine the net's condition.
*   **Outcome:** Finds a [[encounters-objects/Items/Fisherman's Net|Tangled Net]]. If crafting exists, might be repairable into a functional [[encounters-objects/Items/Fisherman's Net|Fishing Net]] (tool for gathering food). Otherwise, minor salvageable materials (cordage fragments?) might be obtainable. Little value as is.

# Discovery Encounter 29: Discover Hidden Spring

*   **Encounter Name:** Unexpected Oasis
*   **Background Story:** While exploring deep in arid regions, high plateaus, or areas far from known water sources, potentially guided by obscure clues or sheer luck, the NPC stumbles upon a life-giving discovery.
*   **Setting Details:** A small seep or spring trickles out from rocks or collects in a small pool, perhaps supporting a tiny patch of green vegetation, where logically there should be none.
*   **Trigger:** Exploring deep desert, high plateaus, areas far from known water. Requires high *[Survival]* or *[Observation]*, or following obscure clues. Very rare.
*   **Effect on NPC:** Finds a small but active [[Water]] source where none was expected. Major discovery, potential lifesaver.
*   **NPC Action:** Verify the water quality (is it potable?). Replenish supplies gratefully. Mark location carefully on any maps.
*   **Outcome:** Significant morale boost. Replenishes [[Water]] supplies. Creates a new, valuable map marker [[New Map Marker]]. Potential major *[Survival]* XP gain. The secrecy of this location might be vital; could be contested if others discover it.
*   **Intrigue:** How is this spring fed? Is it permanent or seasonal? Has anyone else ever found it?
*   **Combat:** No (initially, though such a valuable spot might attract conflict later).
*   **Skill Learned:** Major *[Survival]* XP.
*   **Item Received:** [[Water]] (replenished), [[New Map Marker]].
*   **Player Interaction Point:** No.
*   **Lore Introduced:**
    *   Life finds a way even in the harshest environments. \[[lore.md]]
    *   Secret [[Water]] sources are invaluable discoveries. \[[lore.md]]

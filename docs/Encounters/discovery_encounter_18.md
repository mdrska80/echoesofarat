# Discovery Encounter 18: The Hidden Shrine

*   **Encounter Name:** Shrine to a Forgotten God
*   **Background Story:** Deep within [[The Red Waste]] (or perhaps [[Province of Whispering Sands]]), far from established routes, lies a testament to beliefs lost to time. This hidden alcove, possibly carved during one of the earlier [[Epochs]] or by an isolated community, holds reverence for an entity unknown to the current [[Khemri People]] and their [[Khemri Pantheon]]. Its isolation has protected it from the elements and discovery until now.
*   **Setting Details:** A naturally formed cave mouth or a deliberately hidden alcove behind dense scrub or fallen rocks. The air is still and cool. Dust motes dance in any intruding light. A small, crudely carved stone altar stands against the back wall, bearing weathered idols or symbols unlike those of [[A'shar]] or [[Nefet]]. Faded pigment might hint at original decorations. A sense of profound quiet and forgotten devotion permeates the space.
*   **Trigger:** NPC with high Observation skill successfully spots the hidden entrance while exploring deep ruins, remote caves, or hidden valleys, or follows specific obscure clues found previously (e.g., from [[Encounters/discovery_encounter_16|Partial Map Fragment]]).
*   **Effect on NPC:** Finds a small, secluded structure/alcove containing weathered idols/symbols dedicated to an unfamiliar deity. A sense of mystery, perhaps unease or the sacred, depending on the NPC's traits (e.g., a [[Priests of A'shar|Priest of A'shar]] might feel disturbed, while a [[Seekers of the Veiled Path|Seeker]] might be intrigued).
*   **NPC Action:** Examine the shrine. *[Skill Check: Archaeology (Moderate)]* or *[Skill Check: Lore (Obscure Religions - Hard)]*. The NPC might react based on piety - offering a moment of silence, making a warding sign, or examining with detached curiosity.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   *Success (Archaeology/Lore):* The NPC gains some insight into the symbols or the possible nature of the forgotten god (e.g., 'appears related to earth spirits', 'symbols resemble distorted versions of early [[Ur-Ghul]] iconography', 'predates known Khemri styles'). Potential minor Archaeology/Lore XP. Might identify a [[encounters-objects/Items/Weathered Shrine Offering|Weathered Shrine Offering]] left behind.
    *   *Failure:* The symbols are too alien or degraded. The NPC recognizes it as a shrine but gains no further understanding.
    *   *Optional:* Depending on NPC action (leaving a small offering vs. disturbing the site), could grant a minor temporary buff ('Feeling Watched' - slight bonus to Observation) or debuff ('Lingering Unease' - slight penalty to morale checks).
*   **Intrigue:** Who was this god? When were they worshipped? Are there other hidden shrines? Does this connect to any [[Precursor Civilizations]] or just a forgotten Khemri cult?
*   **Combat:** No.
*   **Skill Learned:** Potential minor Archaeology/Lore XP on success.
*   **Item Received:** Potentially a [[encounters-objects/Items/Weathered Shrine Offering|Weathered Shrine Offering]] (minor artifact/curiosity).
*   **Player Interaction Point:** No (decision handled by NPC traits/AI, outcome influences future events subtly).
*   **Lore Introduced:**
    *   [[encounters-objects/Gods/Forgotten God of the Hidden Shrine]]
    *   [[encounters-objects/Items/Weathered Shrine Offering]]
    *   Reinforces the idea of layered history and lost knowledge.
    *   Hints at potential cults outside the main [[Khemri Pantheon]].

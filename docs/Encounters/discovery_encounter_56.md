# Discovery Encounter 56: Distant Smoke

*   **Encounter Name:** Plume of Smoke
*   **Background Story:** Smoke on the horizon is a clear sign of activity in an otherwise empty landscape. It could signify many things - a cooking fire from a friendly camp, the signal fire of nomads or [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]], a burning structure, or even a natural wildfire. Investigating is inherently risky but could lead to opportunity or necessary information.
*   **Setting Details:** While traveling through open country (desert, scrubland, plains), the NPC spots a distinct column or plume of smoke rising in the distance. Visibility must be reasonably good.
*   **Trigger:** NPC with good Observation skill spots smoke while traveling in open terrain.
*   **Effect on NPC:** Notices the distant smoke. Recognizes it as a sign of fire/activity that warrants attention, though the source is unknown.
*   **NPC Action:** Assess the distance and direction of the smoke. The situation presents a clear choice: investigate or ignore.
*   **Outcome:** This encounter branches based on player choice:
    *   *Investigate:* The NPC(s) deviate from their current course to investigate the smoke source. This takes time and consumes resources. Upon reaching the source, **trigger a subsequent, specific encounter** based on what is found (e.g., `[[Social/NPC Encounter: Nomadic Encampment]]`, `[[Hazard/Combat Encounter: Bandit Camp]]`, `[[Environmental Encounter: Wildfire]]`, `[[Discovery Encounter: Burning Ruin]]` - placeholders for potential follow-up encounters).
    *   *Ignore:* The NPC(s) note the smoke but maintain their current course and objective.
*   **Intrigue:** What is the source of the smoke? Is it friend or foe? Danger or opportunity?
*   **Combat:** Possible, depending on the follow-up encounter triggered by investigation.
*   **Skill Learned:** No (Leads to another encounter).
*   **Item Received:** No (Leads to another encounter).
*   **Player Interaction Point:** Yes. The player is prompted: "Investigate the distant smoke plume (Deviate course, Unknown Outcome) or Ignore it and maintain course?".
*   **Lore Introduced:**
    *   Reinforces that the world is active, with other inhabitants (nomads, bandits, etc.).
    *   Acts as a dynamic link to other potential encounters.

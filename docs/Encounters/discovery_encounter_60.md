# Discovery Encounter 60: Weaver's Craft

*   **Encounter Name:** Intact Woven Basket
*   **Background Story:** Basketry is a vital craft in Khemri, used for storage, transport, and even as funerary goods. Due to the dry climate, woven items made from reeds or grasses can survive for long periods if protected from direct sun and moisture.
*   **Setting Details:** Found inside a ruined dwelling, tucked into a corner of an abandoned storage room, or placed within a tomb as a container for grave goods. The basket is remarkably intact, perhaps still showing traces of original color or decorative patterns. It might have a fitted lid.
*   **Trigger:** NPC searches domestic ruins, tombs, or storage areas.
*   **Effect on NPC:** Finds a well-preserved, beautifully woven basket, notable for its condition.
*   **NPC Action:** Examine the basket's craftsmanship. Check carefully for any contents (likely just dust, but small items could be hidden).
*   **Outcome:** The NPC recovers an `[[encounters-objects/Items/Woven Basket]]`. It's in good condition and can be added to inventory. It has minor trade value or could potentially be used as an inventory container (if mechanics permit). Rarely, it might contain a minor preserved item (e.g., dried seeds, a bead). Gain minor Observation XP.
*   **Intrigue:** What was this basket originally used for? Who made it? Does the weaving style indicate a specific region or time period?
*   **Combat:** No.
*   **Skill Learned:** Minor Observation XP.
*   **Item Received:** `[[encounters-objects/Items/Woven Basket]]`, potentially minor contents.
*   **Player Interaction Point:** No.
*   **Lore Introduced:**
    *   Highlights the craft of basket weaving.
    *   Introduces `[[encounters-objects/Items/Woven Basket]]` as an item.

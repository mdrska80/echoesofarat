# Discovery Encounter 39: Find Wasp Nest in Skull

*   **Encounter Name:** Macabre Hive
*   **Background Story:** While exploring dark, sheltered places like tombs, ruins, or caves, the NPC comes across a disturbing sight.
*   **Setting Details:** An [[encounters-objects/Items/Ancient Skull|Ancient Skull]] rests on the ground or a ledge, but movement or buzzing reveals an active wasp nest constructed inside its cavities.
*   **Trigger:** Exploring tombs, ruins, caves. Macabre minor discovery.

*   **NPC Action:** Observe cautiously from a distance. Decide whether to approach (risky).
*   **Outcome:** A grim tableau. Approaching risks disturbing wasps (Hazard: [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Bees|Wasp Swarm]]).

Primarily an atmospheric discovery adding to the location's creepiness.

*   **Item Received:** No.
*   **Player Interaction Point:** No (NPC likely avoids disturbing it unless specifically commanded).
*   **Lore Introduced:**
    *   Nature, including insects like [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Bees|Wasps]], occupies and reclaims ruins and remains. \[[lore.md]]

# Discovery Encounter 58: Mark of the Sun-King

*   **Encounter Name:** Royal Boundary Stone
*   **Background Story:** The [[Sun-Kings]] of Khemri demarcated their lands, particularly royal estates, temple domains, or administrative districts, using carved boundary stones or stelae. Finding one confirms the historical importance of the area and its connection to the ruling dynasties.
*   **Setting Details:** Partially buried in the earth at the edge of a field, near the foundations of a major ruin, or along an ancient road. The stone is typically a sturdy block or stela, weathered but bearing clearly carved `[[Concept: Royal Insignia]]`, possibly including the `[[Concept: Cartouche]]` of a specific [[Sun-Kings|Sun-King]] (e.g., [[Aran IV]]). Requires digging or clearing debris to fully reveal.
*   **Trigger:** NPC explores an area historically associated with royalty (e.g., near `[[A'shar's Resplendence]]`) or follows specific map clues. Requires digging/searching action and potentially an Observation check to notice the partially exposed stone.
*   **Effect on NPC:** Unearths a carved stone marker bearing official royal symbols.
*   **NPC Action:** Examine the inscriptions and insignia carefully. *[Skill Check: Archaeology (Moderate)]* to identify the specific ruler or dynasty, if possible, and understand the context.
*   **Outcome:**
    *   *Success:* The NPC recognizes the `[[Location Feature: Royal Boundary Stone]]` and potentially identifies the associated [[Sun-Kings|Sun-King]] or era. Gain significant Archaeology XP. This is an important historical find. Removing or damaging it could cause significant trouble with current authorities if discovered.
    *   *Failure:* The NPC recognizes it as an important marker but cannot decipher the specific royal connection.
*   **Intrigue:** Which specific territory did this stone mark? Why was it placed here? Does its presence align with known historical records or challenge them?
*   **Combat:** No, but disturbing the marker could lead to social conflict later.
*   **Skill Learned:** Significant Archaeology XP.
*   **Item Received:** No (Marker is too large and significant to take).
*   **Player Interaction Point:** No.
*   **Lore Introduced:**
    *   `[[Location Feature: Royal Boundary Stone]]`
    *   `[[Concept: Royal Insignia]]`
    *   `[[Concept: Cartouche]]`
    *   Reinforces the role and history of the [[Sun-Kings]].

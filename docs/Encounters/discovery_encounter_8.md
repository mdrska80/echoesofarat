# Discovery Encounter 8: Discover Animal Tracks

*   **Encounter Name:** Signs of Wildlife
*   **Background Story:** While traveling through the wilderness, desert paths, or near vital [[Water]] sources, the NPC notices clear footprints left in the sand or mud, indicating recent animal activity.
*   **Setting Details:** The ground is soft enough to hold prints clearly - perhaps near a riverbank, an oasis edge, a sandy dune field, or a muddy patch after rare rain.
*   **Trigger:** Traveling through wilderness, desert, near water sources.
*   **Effect on NPC:** Notices distinct animal footprints.
*   **NPC Action:** Examine the tracks closely. *[Potential Skill Check: Survival]*
*   **Outcome:**
    *   *Success:* Identifies the animal (e.g., [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Gazelle|Gazelle]], [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Hyena|Hyena]], [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Crocodile|Crocodile]], [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Desert Birds|Birds]]). Can estimate the age of the tracks and the direction of travel. May lead towards prey (potential food source), water, or a predator's lair (danger, e.g., [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Desert Lion|Lion Pride]] territory). Gain minor *[Survival]* XP. Player might be prompted if tracks indicate significant danger/opportunity.
    *   *Failure:* Cannot identify the animal or discern clear information from the tracks.
*   **Intrigue:** What animals frequent this area? Are they a potential resource or a threat? Do the tracks lead somewhere significant?
*   **Combat:** No, but may lead to a combat encounter if the tracks are followed, especially if they belong to predators.
*   **Skill Learned:** Minor *[Survival]* XP on success.
*   **Item Received:** No. Information gained.
*   **Player Interaction Point:** Yes (Rarely). If tracks clearly indicate both significant opportunity (e.g., large herd of prey) and significant danger (e.g., [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Desert Lion|Lion Pride]] territory), player might be asked: "Follow the tracks (Risky) or Avoid the area?".
*   **Lore Introduced:**
    *   Common fauna of the region (e.g., [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Gazelle|Gazelle]], [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Hyena|Hyena]], [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Crocodile|Crocodile]]). \[[lore.md]]

# Discovery Encounter 4: Stele of the Skyfall Harvest

*   **Encounter Name:** Find the Stele of the Skyfall Harvest
*   **Background Story:** Near A'shar's Resplendence, the expedition explores the colossal ruins of the Sun-King's Granaries. These structures incorporate strange, smooth metal beams (salvaged Star-Weaver material?) alongside Khemri sandstone. Scribe Vorin 'the Lesser' oversaw their reconstruction after the 'Year of Skyfall', and the expedition seeks evidence of *what* exactly fell.
*   **Setting Details:** Massive storage silos, partly collapsed, loom overhead. The air smells of ancient grain dust and ozone near the metallic beams. A large stele fragment, carved with Khemri glyphs, lies near a damaged beam that seems to have sheared through it.
*   **Trigger:** Locating the stele fragment near the damaged Star-Weaver beam.
*   **Effect on NPC:** Notices the clean cut through the stone stele, contrasting with the weathered breaks elsewhere â€“ as if the metal beam fell or was installed *after* the stele was carved.
*   **NPC Action:** Cleans and deciphers the text. *[Potential Skill Check: Lore (Khemri Glyphs), Archaeology]*
*   **Outcome:**
    *   *Success:* Reads: "...Sun-King Aran IV... Scribe Vorin 'the Lesser'... appointed Overseer... Year of Skyfall Harvest... grain tithe doubled... utilizing the blessed Sky-Metal fragments...". Confirms salvaged Precursor tech used in rebuilding after Skyfall. Gain Archaeology XP.
    *   *Partial Success:* Makes out Vorin's name, the granary title, and 'Skyfall', but misses the 'Sky-Metal' reference or harvest details.
    *   *Failure:* Text too damaged/complex.
*   **Intrigue:** 'Skyfall Harvest' implies something was *gathered* after the event. Was it Star-Weaver debris? The doubling of the grain tithe suggests hardship or a massive new project. Did Vorin's access to salvaged 'Sky-Metal' lead to his later disgrace? Was he experimenting? Could Star-Weaver tech be buried beneath the granaries?
*   **Combat:** No.
*   **Skill Learned:** Archaeology/Lore XP.
*   **Item Received:** Information only. Marked as 'Stele of the Skyfall Harvest' (Clue).
*   **Player Interaction Point:** No.

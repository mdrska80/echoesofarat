# Discovery Encounter 43: Locate Old River Dock

*   **Encounter Name:** Sunken Pier
*   **Background Story:** While traveling along the banks of [[The Great River Arat]] or another large waterway, possibly near ruins of a settlement or following an old map, the NPC notices signs of construction at the water's edge.
*   **Setting Details:** Stone or wooden pilings, perhaps connected by remnants of a platform, extend into the water. Much of the structure is likely submerged or washed away, covered in silt and algae.
*   **Trigger:** Exploring River banks, especially near former settlements or trade points shown on old maps.
*   **Effect on NPC:** Discovers stone or wooden pilings and platform remnants at the river's edge, hinting at a past [[encounters-objects/Locations/Old River Dock|Old River Dock]].
*   **NPC Action:** Examine the dock structure and surrounding water depth. *[Potential Skill Check: Observation or Cartography]*. Assess potential hazards like submerged debris or [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Crocodile|Crocodiles]].
*   **Outcome:** Identifies a potential (perhaps hazardous) mooring point or crossing location. May find dropped items in the shallow water nearby (low chance, e.g., broken pottery, lost tool). Indicates historical importance of the location for transport/trade. Minor *[Observation]*/*[Cartography]* XP.
*   **Intrigue:** What settlement or trade route did this dock serve? Why was it abandoned? What might be lost in the deeper water nearby?
*   **Combat:** No (but water can hide [[encounters-objects/Fauna/Crocodile|Crocodiles]] - potential separate hazard).
*   **Skill Learned:** Minor *[Observation]*/*[Cartography]* XP.
*   **Item Received:** No (rare chance of minor item in water).
*   **Player Interaction Point:** No.
*   **Lore Introduced:**
    *   River transport was vital, necessitating structures like docks. \[[lore.md]]
    *   Changing water levels or decaying settlements left behind ruined infrastructure. \[[lore.md]]

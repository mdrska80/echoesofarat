## I. Natural Khemri Fauna

Creatures native to the environment of Khemri, influenced by its unique geography but not inherently supernatural or Precursor-related (though some may be feared or mythologized).

### 1. River Crocodile (Meseh)

*   **(Type: Reptile, Natural Fauna)**
*   **Appearance:** Large, heavily armored reptile with powerful jaws. Well-adapted to the [[The Great River Arat]]. Sizes vary, with older specimens reaching formidable lengths.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Ambush predator, often lurking submerged near riverbanks. Capable of sudden bursts of speed on land over short distances. Possesses immense bite force. Primarily territorial and hunts fish, birds, and unwary land animals.
*   **Habitat:** [[The Great River Arat]] and associated marshlands [[Papyrus Swamp]]. Sometimes basks on sandbanks.
*   **Dangers:** Lethal ambush predator near water sources. Can capsize small boats ([[Reed Boat Ferry Crossing]]). Difficult to kill due to thick hide.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Respected and feared by the Khemri. Associated with the god Sobek (if included in Pantheon). Crocodile hunting might be a dangerous but prestigious activity. Their presence dictates caution near the river.

### 2. Desert Scorpion (Serqet's Sting)

*   **(Type: Arachnid, Natural Fauna)**
*   **Appearance:** Various species exist, from small, pale scorpions hiding under rocks to larger, darker varieties found in ruins or caves. Possess pincers and a segmented tail tipped with a venomous stinger.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Nocturnal predators, hunting insects and small lizards. Use venom to subdue prey or defend themselves. Some species have potent neurotoxins dangerous to humans.
*   **Habitat:** Common throughout [[The Whispering Sands]] and rocky areas [[Rocky Wadi (Dry riverbed)]]. Often found seeking shelter in ruins, under debris, or even inside Khemri dwellings.
*   **Dangers:** Venomous sting can cause intense pain, paralysis, or death depending on the species and victim's health. Risk of stepping on one or finding one in bedding/equipment.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Symbol of danger in the desert. Associated with the goddess Serqet (protection against venom). Their presence is a constant, low-level threat during desert travel.

### 3. Sand Viper (Hebenet)

*   **(Type: Reptile, Natural Fauna)**
*   **Appearance:** Relatively small but highly venomous snake, perfectly camouflaged against sand and rock. Distinctive triangular head and often horn-like scales above the eyes.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Ambush predator, often burying itself in sand with only its eyes exposed. Strikes extremely quickly. Possesses potent hemotoxic venom that causes severe tissue damage and bleeding.
*   **Habitat:** Sandy deserts [[The Whispering Sands]], rocky outcrops, sometimes found near oases [[Khenet Oasis]].
*   **Dangers:** Difficult to spot due to camouflage. Lightning-fast strike. Highly dangerous venom requires immediate (and likely rare/expensive) treatment.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Embodiment of hidden desert threats. Finding antivenom could be a quest objective. Their presence makes desert travel perilous.

### 4. Vulture (Neretet)

*   **(Type: Bird, Natural Fauna)**
*   **Appearance:** Large scavenger bird with a bald head, sharp beak, and broad wingspan. Circles high above the desert searching for carrion.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Primarily scavenger, feeding on dead animals. Possesses keen eyesight. Generally not aggressive towards humans unless cornered or protecting a nest. Can gather in large numbers at carcasses.
*   **Habitat:** Widespread, especially in deserts [[The Whispering Sands]] and near settlements or battlefields where carrion might be found. Nests on cliffs or in tall ruins.
*   **Dangers:** Minimal direct threat, but their presence can indicate nearby death or danger (e.g., circling over a recent kill site or a lost traveler). Might harass severely weakened individuals.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Associated with death and purification by the Khemri. Sometimes linked to goddesses like Nekhbet. Their presence is an omen, often ill.

### 5. Desert Oryx (Ma'ahedj)

*   **(Type: Mammal, Natural Fauna)**
*   **Appearance:** Large antelope with long, straight horns, a pale coat, and distinctive dark markings on the face and legs. Well-adapted to arid environments.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Herbivore, travels in small herds searching for sparse vegetation and water sources [[Desert Oasis]]. Can survive long periods without drinking. Wary of predators, uses horns for defense if cornered.
*   **Habitat:** Arid plains and deserts [[The Whispering Sands]], [[Scrubland]].
*   **Dangers:** Not typically aggressive, but can be dangerous if threatened or defending young. Horns are sharp.
*   **Significance/Lore:** A symbol of resilience and the desert's harsh beauty. Hunted by Khemri and desert nomads for meat and hides. Depicted in Khemri art.

## II. Precursor-Influenced & Supernatural Entities

Creatures resulting from Precursor activity, magical anomalies, or entities from Khemri myth and folklore.

### 6. Geometer's Echo (Elder One Entity)

*   **(Type: Aberration, Elder One Origin)**
*   **Appearance:** Not a physical creature, but a localized spatial distortion that mimics movement and intent. Might appear as a vaguely humanoid shape made of shifting angles, a floating cluster of impossible geometry ([[Shard of Impossible Geometry]]), or simply an area where physics behaves erratically. May emit discordant sounds or psychic whispers.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** 'Patrols' areas within [[Elder One Tunnel Network Entrance|Elder One ruins]]. Does not attack physically but warps space around intruders, potentially trapping them in loops, redirecting attacks, causing intense vertigo/madness, or shunting them into other dimensions. Immune to conventional harm.
*   **Habitat:** Restricted to areas of strong Elder One influence, particularly their architectural remnants.
*   **Dangers:** Severe psychological damage ([[Psychic Resistance/Sensitivity]] vital). Risk of being trapped, lost, or dimensionally displaced. Conventional combat is useless. Avoidance or finding a way to disrupt the local geometry is key.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Represents the passive, environmental danger of Elder One sites. Not truly alive, but a remnant of their reality-shaping power acting like a sentinel.

### 7. Serpent-Amphibian (Tekhen-nu) (Serpent Sovereign Bio-Construct)

*   **(Type: Monstrosity, Serpent Sovereign Origin)**
*   **Appearance:** Unsettling hybrid creature combining serpentine and amphibian traits. May have smooth, moist skin, multiple limbs ending in webbed claws, a long serpentine tail, and a wide, fanged maw. Possibly bioluminescent patches [[Bio-luminescent Pearl]]. Size varies.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Amphibious predator, comfortable in water and on land. May possess paralytic venom, constricting ability, or camouflage capabilities. Likely territorial and aggressive. Some might exhibit rudimentary intelligence or coordinated pack behavior.
*   **Habitat:** Submerged ruins, ancient waterways, damp caves, polluted oases near [[Serpent Sovereigns]] sites.
*   **Dangers:** Vicious predator with multiple attack modes (bite, constriction, claws, venom). Amphibious nature allows attacks from unexpected directions.
*   **Significance/Lore:** A living example of Serpent Sovereign bio-engineering. Their presence indicates proximity to Epoch 2 ruins or contamination. [[Serpent Cultists]] might revere or attempt to control them.

### 8. Star-Weaver Sentinel (Malfunctioning Automaton)

*   **(Type: Construct, Star-Weaver Origin)**
*   **Appearance:** Bipedal or multi-limbed automaton made of 'star-metal' alloys. Design can be sleek or insectoid. Often damaged, with exposed wiring or missing limbs. May have glowing optical sensors (often red or flickering erratically) and integrated energy weapons [[Star-Weaver Diagnostic Tool]].
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Follows ancient, corrupted patrol routes or defensive protocols. Engages intruders with built-in weaponry (energy pulses, kinetic projectiles) or physical force. Lacks true intelligence but follows programmed directives rigidly, often inefficiently due to damage/decay. Might be vulnerable to specific energy frequencies or logic bombs if [[Engineering (Precursor Tech)]] skill is high.
*   **Habitat:** Found within or near [[Star-Weavers]] installations, power plants, or crash sites.
*   **Dangers:** Possesses advanced weaponry dangerous to Khemri-level technology/armor. Relentless and tireless. Immune to biological effects (poison, disease). May explode upon destruction.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Remnants of Star-Weaver security or labor force. Highlights their advanced robotics and metallurgy. Studying them offers insight into their technology but risks activating dormant defenses.

### 9. Chronovore Mote (Chronomancer Anomaly)

*   **(Type: Anomaly/Outsider, Chronomancer Origin)**
*   **Appearance:** Often invisible or appears as a shimmering heat haze or a localized blur in time. May manifest briefly as a swarm of crystalline insects or a vortex of [[Dust of Frozen Moments]]. Detected by a feeling of temporal drag or objects aging/de-aging rapidly nearby.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Not truly a creature, but a localized temporal anomaly that 'feeds' on temporal potential. Anything entering its area of influence experiences rapid aging or de-aging, potentially cycling through possibilities. Prolonged exposure can erase something from time or trap it in a loop. Attracted to areas of temporal instability or paradox.
*   **Habitat:** Areas with strong [[Chronomancers]] influence, near temporal devices, or sites of major paradoxes.
*   **Dangers:** Extreme temporal hazard. Can cause rapid aging to dust, de-aging to infancy, or trapping victims in repeating time loops. Physical attacks are useless as they rarely have a stable physical form. Avoidance or stabilizing the local time field is the only defense. [[Temporal Sense/Anomaly Navigation]] essential for detection/avoidance.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Represents the uncontrolled, hazardous side effects of Chronomancer experiments. A dangerous environmental hazard rather than a traditional monster.

### 10. Sand Spirit (Afret) (Khemri Folklore/Possible Entity)

*   **(Type: Spirit/Elemental?, Origin Uncertain)**
*   **Appearance:** Often described as a swirling column of sand and dust taking a vaguely humanoid or bestial shape, with glowing eyes. May appear during intense sandstorms [[Tjau-aat]]. Its form constantly shifts and dissipates.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Said to lead travelers astray, steal breath, or drive victims mad with whispering voices carried on the wind. May have minor control over wind and sand within its immediate vicinity. Possibly vulnerable to water, specific rituals, or true names. Might be intangible or reform after disruption.
*   **Habitat:** Deep desert [[The Whispering Sands]], particularly during sandstorms or near places associated with great thirst or despair. Some link them to [[K'thos (The Desert Fury)]].
*   **Dangers:** Disorientation, suffocation (inhaling sand), madness. Can separate members of a party. Physical attacks may be ineffective.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Embodies the Khemri fear of the deep desert's disorienting and deadly nature. Represents madness born of isolation and heat. Could be a genuine elemental spirit, a collective psychic manifestation, or misidentified natural phenomena.

### 11. Giant River Catfish (Narmet)

*   **(Type: Fish, Natural Fauna)**
*   **Appearance:** Enormous catfish dwelling in the deepest channels of [[The Great River Arat]]. Can grow to sizes capable of swallowing a man whole. Greyish-brown, armored skin, wide mouth with rows of small teeth, and long barbels.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Bottom-dweller, primarily scavenger but opportunistic predator. Uses barbels to sense vibrations. Can overturn small boats or drag struggling victims underwater. Slow-moving but immensely strong.
*   **Habitat:** Deep sections of [[The Great River Arat]], murky pools, possibly submerged ruins.
*   **Dangers:** Drowning hazard, can capsize boats, powerful enough to injure or kill if encountered directly in water. Difficult to land if hooked.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Legendary river monsters in Khemri folklore. Catching one would be a feat of strength and skill. Might be considered sacred or taboo to hunt in certain regions.

### 12. Rock Baboon (Ian)

*   **(Type: Mammal, Natural Fauna)**
*   **Appearance:** Large, sturdy baboons adapted to rocky terrain. Thick fur (grey/brown), prominent canine teeth, dog-like muzzle. Males are larger and more aggressive.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Live in troops with complex social structures. Omnivorous, foraging for roots, insects, scorpions, and occasionally small animals or unattended food stores. Highly intelligent and territorial. Will defend their territory aggressively, using numbers and intimidation (barking, displays). Can climb sheer rock faces.
*   **Habitat:** Rocky hills [[Djew]], wadis [[Rocky Wadi (Dry riverbed)]], cliffs near the river valley. Sometimes raid farmland or outskirts of settlements [[Abandoned Mudbrick Settlement]].
*   **Dangers:** Can be very aggressive in groups, especially if cornered or their troop is threatened. Bites can be severe. Known to throw rocks from heights. Can steal supplies.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Common but potentially dangerous wildlife. Sometimes associated with the god Thoth (in his baboon aspect) or seen as pests. Their presence near ruins might indicate relative safety from larger predators or specific resources.

### 13. Tomb Scarab Swarm

*   **(Type: Insect Swarm, Natural/Supernatural?)**
*   **Appearance:** A dense, roiling mass of countless flesh-eating scarab beetles, often emerging from cracks in tomb walls or sarcophagi. Larger than normal scarabs, with stronger mandibles.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Mindless collective hunger. Swarms over living creatures, stripping flesh from bone with horrifying speed. Can squeeze through tiny openings. Drawn to vibrations, scent of blood, or possibly disturbed psychic energy in tombs. Possibly repelled by fire [[Torches (Bundle)]] or specific chemicals/rituals.
*   **Habitat:** Primarily found within tombs [[Simple Rock-Cut Tomb (Minor Noble)], [[Mastaba Field]], necropolises, especially those that have been disturbed or are subject to minor curses.
*   **Dangers:** Overwhelming numbers can strip a creature clean in minutes. Bites are individually small but collectively lethal. Can cause panic and block passages.
*   **Significance/Lore:** A terrifying hazard of tomb exploration. Seen by Khemri as guardians of the dead or a manifestation of decay and divine wrath against desecration. Distinct from the revered single [[Scarab Amulet (Protective)]].

### 14. Animated Khemri Statue (Tjet)

*   **(Type: Construct, Khemri Magic/Curse)**
*   **Appearance:** A statue carved in the Khemri style (humanoid, animal, or divine figure) that has been animated through magic, curses, or bound spirits. Movement is often stiff and grinding. Material varies (stone, wood, bronze). Size can range from small Ushabti-like figures to colossal temple guardians.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Follows simple commands or programmed behaviors (guarding an area, attacking intruders). Strength depends on size and material. Often mindless automatons, but some might retain echoes of a bound spirit's personality or purpose. May possess immunities related to their material (immune to fire if stone, etc.).
*   **Habitat:** Tombs, temples [[Karnak Temple Complex (Exterior)]], shrines [[Small Shrine (Local deity)]], vaults containing protected items.
*   **Dangers:** Relentless attackers. Strength can be immense. Immune to pain, fear, morale effects. Might require specific rituals, powerful blows to specific points, or solving the puzzle of their animation to defeat.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Represents Khemri attempts (successful or accidental) at creating guardians or servants through magic or binding rituals. Distinct from Precursor constructs. [[Theology/Ritualism]] skill might be relevant.

### 15. Whispering Mummy (Khaibit's Echo)

*   **(Type: Undead, Khemri Funerary Ritual/Curse)**
*   **Appearance:** A poorly preserved or desecrated Khemri mummy, often shambling and emitting dry whispers or moans. Bandages may be loose or trailing. Might still clutch funerary items. Emits an aura of dread and decay.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Driven by residual impulses, negative emotions imprinted during death/burial, or a curse. Attacks mindlessly with surprising strength or unnatural speed. Touch might inflict disease, curses, or drain vitality. Whispers might cause fear or madness. May be vulnerable to fire or specific religious rites/symbols.
*   **Habitat:** Disturbed tombs, desecrated burial grounds, cursed necropolises.
*   **Dangers:** Disease, curses, vitality drain, fear effects. Physically resilient due to dessicated state. Can be surprisingly strong or fast.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Represents the dark side of Khemri funerary beliefs – the consequences of improper burial, desecration, or powerful curses laid upon tombs. A perversion of the desired afterlife journey.

### 16. Angler Worm (Elder One Parasite/Symbiote?)

*   **(Type: Aberration, Elder One Origin)**
*   **Appearance:** A large, worm-like creature composed of shifting, translucent flesh that seems to refract light incorrectly. Possesses a lure made of pulsating, hypnotic light patterns or a dangling [[Shard of Impossible Geometry]]. Mouth is a circular maw lined with hooked, non-Euclidean teeth.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Lurks in darkness or areas of spatial distortion within Elder One ruins. Uses its lure to draw victims closer with psychic suggestion or visual fascination. When prey is near, it lunges, attempting to swallow victims whole or pull them into its distorted gullet, potentially digesting them across multiple dimensions or timelines.
*   **Habitat:** Deep within [[Elder One Tunnel Network Entrance|Elder One tunnels]] or structures, often near dimensional weak points or energy sources.
*   **Dangers:** Hypnotic lure bypasses conventional defenses. Bite can cause spatial displacement even if not fatal. Being swallowed is likely a fate worse than death (madness, non-existence). [[Psychic Resistance/Sensitivity]] needed to resist lure.
*   **Significance/Lore:** A predatory life form adapted to the bizarre physics of Elder One environments. May be a native creature or something created/altered by their influence. Its lure hints at the deceptive nature of Elder One 'treasures'.

### 17. Serpent Sovereign Coral Polyp Swarm

*   **(Type: Plant/Construct Swarm, Serpent Sovereign Origin)**
*   **Appearance:** A dense mass of seemingly inert, razor-sharp coral polyps lining walls or floors of submerged ruins. Polyps might be crystalline or metallic in composition, often with bio-luminescent traces.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Dormant until detecting vibrations or bio-signatures in the water. Then, polyps rapidly extend barbed tendrils or fire calcified shards, creating a deadly cloud in the water. Acts as an area-denial defense mechanism. May filter water for nutrients or energy.
*   **Habitat:** Walls, floors, and ceilings of submerged [[Serpent Sovereigns]] structures, particularly chokepoints or important chambers.
*   **Dangers:** Creates zones of extreme hazard in water. Tendrils cause deep lacerations, shards can pierce armor. Can trigger rapidly, filling an area with projectiles. Requires careful navigation or methods to neutralize the swarm (chemicals? sonic frequencies?). [[Hydrology/Aquatic Adaptation]] skill useful for avoidance.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Represents Serpent Sovereign defensive systems integrated directly into their architecture using bio-engineered materials. Shows their preference for aquatic hazards.

### 18. Star-Weaver Phase Spider

*   **(Type: Vermin/Construct?, Star-Weaver Origin)**
*   **Appearance:** A large, spider-like entity made of shimmering 'star-metal' filaments and lenses. Moves with unnatural speed and silence. Its most notable feature is the ability to briefly shift out of phase with reality, appearing to teleport short distances or become temporarily intangible.
  ![[Pasted image 20250420005014.png]]
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Ambush predator or security measure. Uses phase-shifting to bypass obstacles, flank targets, or avoid attacks. May attack with energized bites, projectile energy webs, or sharp metallic limbs. Possibly drawn to energy sources or specific technological signatures.
*   **Habitat:** Ventilation shafts, maintenance tunnels, data conduits, or power cores within [[Star-Weavers]] installations. Occasionally found scavenging outside near active tech.
*   **Dangers:** Phasing makes it extremely difficult to track or hit. Attacks can come from unexpected angles. Energy webs might drain power or restrain victims. Might require specialized weapons or tactics (area effects, predicting phase jumps) to defeat.
*   **Significance/Lore:** An example of advanced Star-Weaver technology applied to infiltration or pest control/defense. Its phasing ability hints at their mastery over dimensional or energy states beyond simple robotics.

### 19. Chronomancer Temporal Hound

*   **(Type: Beast/Construct?, Chronomancer Origin)**
*   **Appearance:** Resembles a large, lean hunting dog, but its form seems unstable, flickering with temporal echoes or trailing after-images. Might appear partially aged or perpetually 'young'. Eyes glow with captured starlight or temporal energy.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Tracks targets not just through space, but through time, following their recent temporal wake. Attacks with bites that cause localized aging/de-aging or displace the target slightly in time (causing disorientation, brief loops). Can move in bursts of unnatural speed (minor time acceleration). Possibly used by Chronomancers for tracking, retrieval, or guarding time-sensitive locations.
*   **Habitat:** Areas with Chronomancer presence, especially those where time manipulation has occurred. Might guard [[Chronomancer Time-Lock Box|Time-Lock Boxes]] or paradox sites.
*   **Dangers:** Difficult to evade due to temporal tracking. Bites inflict debilitating temporal effects. Unpredictable movement speed. Might be vulnerable to paradoxes or stabilization fields. [[Temporal Sense/Anomaly Navigation]] skill useful for prediction/defense.
*   **Significance/Lore:** A specialized creation for navigating or policing temporal matters. Shows Chronomancers applied their skills even to creating 'beasts' or guardians tailored to their unique domain.

### 20. Oasis Nymph (Maia) (Khemri Folklore/Possible Fey)

*   **(Type: Fey/Spirit?, Origin Uncertain)**
*   **Appearance:** Often depicted as a beautiful humanoid figure (male or female) seemingly woven from water, mist, and oasis vegetation [[Date Palm Grove]]. May appear elusive, visible only from the corner of the eye or in shimmering heat haze.
  ![[Pasted image 20250420005158.png]]
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Guardian spirit of a specific [[Desert Oasis]]. Generally benevolent if respected, ensuring water purity [[Khen-mw]] and plant health. Might offer cryptic guidance, aid lost travelers, or bestow minor boons (healing water, temporary luck). Can become vengeful if the oasis is polluted, depleted, or desecrated, potentially causing water to become poisonous [[Mw-qed]], plants to wither, or travelers to become lost. May command oasis wildlife or manipulate water/plants locally.
*   **Habitat:** Tied to a specific, often hidden or pristine, desert oasis.
*   **Dangers:** Minimal if respected. If angered, can poison water supplies, cause disorientation, or use natural hazards (flash floods, animal attacks) against offenders. Direct confrontation might be difficult due to elusive nature.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Represents the Khemri belief in local nature spirits guarding vital resources. Embodies the life-giving but fragile nature of oases. Encounters depend heavily on NPC actions and respect for the location. Could be a true fey spirit, a localized psychic phenomenon, or even a subtle [[Serpent Sovereigns]] ecological regulator misunderstood by locals.

### 21. Hippopotamus (Deb)

*   **(Type: Mammal, Natural Fauna)**
*   **Appearance:** Massive, semi-aquatic mammal with thick greyish skin, short legs, enormous tusks, and a huge mouth. Spends much of its time in the river.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Highly territorial, especially males defending pods or females protecting calves. Deceptively fast on land over short distances and dangerous in water. Can stay submerged for several minutes. Attacks by biting, goring with tusks, or trampling. Responsible for more human deaths than crocodiles in some areas.
*   **Habitat:** [[The Great River Arat]], associated lakes and swamps [[Papyrus Swamp]]. Grazes on riverbanks at night.
*   **Dangers:** Extremely aggressive and territorial. Will attack boats and people without provocation if they feel threatened or encroached upon. Immense strength and powerful bite/tusks.
*   **Significance/Lore:** A powerful and dangerous force of nature. Sometimes associated with the goddess Taweret (protection in childbirth) or the destructive aspects of Set. Hunting them is incredibly dangerous. Their presence restricts safe access to certain river areas.

### 22. Fennec Fox (Fenek)

*   **(Type: Mammal, Natural Fauna)**
*   **Appearance:** Small nocturnal fox with distinctively large ears, sandy fur for camouflage, and a bushy tail. Adapted for desert life.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Primarily insectivorous but also eats rodents, eggs, and fruit. Large ears help dissipate heat and locate prey underground. Lives in small family groups in burrows dug in sand or dunes. Shy and elusive.
*   **Habitat:** Sandy deserts [[The Whispering Sands]], dunes.
*   **Dangers:** None to humans. Might be hunted for fur (rarely) or kept as exotic pets (even rarer).
*   **Significance/Lore:** Represents adaptability to the harsh desert environment. Generally seen neutrally or positively by Khemri, admired for its cleverness and survival skills.

### 23. Possessed Khemri (Shemau-Isfet)

*   **(Type: Humanoid/Aberration?, Origin Varies - Khemri Cultist/Curse/Entity)**
*   **Appearance:** A living Khemri exhibiting signs of possession: unnatural strength/speed, distorted features, glowing eyes, speaking in strange voices or unknown languages ([[Khemri Language#Precursor Languages]]), self-mutilation, extreme hostility. Appearance varies depending on possessing entity/influence.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Controlled by an external entity (malevolent spirit, Precursor influence leak, cult ritual gone wrong). Actions are unpredictable but usually violent and chaotic, reflecting [[Isfet]]. May exhibit specific powers related to the possessor (minor psychic abilities, resistance to harm, spreading corruption). Might target religious symbols or specific individuals.
*   **Habitat:** Anywhere, but more common near sites of intense psychic stress, chaotic magic, Precursor contamination, or [[Serpent Cultists]] activity.
*   **Dangers:** Unpredictable violence, unnatural physical capabilities, potential to spread possession or corruption. Defeating the possessed might require exorcism rituals ([[Theology/Ritualism]]) or targeting the possessing entity rather than just the host body.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Represents the dangers of chaotic forces, forbidden rituals, and Precursor influence bleeding into the Khemri population. A source of fear and social disruption. [[Wardens]] and priests would likely try to contain or destroy them quickly.

### 24. Guardian Sphinx (Akhet-Heru) (Khemri Magical Construct/Possible Precursor Echo)

*   **(Type: Magical Beast/Construct, Khemri Elite Magic/Possible Precursor Influence)**
*   **Appearance:** A classical sphinx statue (lion's body, human head, sometimes wings) animated as a guardian. Typically large, made of stone. May possess an unnerving semblance of intelligence in its eyes. Some suspect the oldest sphinxes incorporate misunderstood Precursor technology or are bound with powerful elemental spirits.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Powerful guardian, often bound to protect a specific site (royal tomb, major temple entrance [[Luxor Temple (Exterior)]], sacred archive). May pose riddles or tests to those seeking passage, attacking only if the test is failed or ignored. Possesses great physical strength, durability (stone form), and potentially minor magical abilities (localized tremors, blasts of wind, paralyzing gaze).
*   **Habitat:** Entrances to major tombs, temples, or sites of great significance. Often positioned prominently.
*   **Dangers:** Immense physical threat. Magical abilities. Riddles might be obscure or deadly if answered incorrectly. Destroying one is extremely difficult. May only be bypassed through solving its riddle or using specific appeasement rituals.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Represents the pinnacle of Khemri guardian magic, blending royal power and divine protection. The riddle aspect suggests intelligence beyond simple constructs. Older examples might hint at deeper connections to Precursor knowledge or power, perhaps misunderstood [[Star-Weavers]] AI or [[Elder Ones]] psychic constructs adapted by Khemri magic.

### 25. Mire Serpent (Neheb-ka)

*   **(Type: Reptile/Monstrosity, Natural/Possible Serpent Sovereign Echo?)**
*   **Appearance:** A massive serpent adapted to swamps and marshes [[Papyrus Swamp]]. Mottled green and brown scales for camouflage. May possess multiple heads, venomous spit, or constricting coils. Some legends claim they are ancient beings or offspring of Apep/Apophis (chaos serpent).
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Ambush predator lurking in murky water or dense reeds. Uses camouflage effectively. Can constrict large prey, deliver venomous bites, or spit blinding/corrosive venom. Highly territorial.
*   **Habitat:** Deep within papyrus swamps, stagnant backwaters of the [[The Great River Arat]], possibly guarding submerged ruins or pathways.
*   **Dangers:** Powerful constrictor, dangerous venom (bite or spit). Difficult to spot before it attacks. Can operate both in water and on swampy ground.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Embodies the dangers of the untamed swamps. Represents primordial chaos in Khemri mythology. Could be a natural creature exaggerated by legend, or perhaps a mutated animal influenced by dormant [[Serpent Sovereigns]] environmental toxins or genetics.

### 26. Fractured Construct (Elder One Ruin Hazard)

*   **(Type: Aberration/Construct, Elder One Origin)**
*   **Appearance:** Appears as disjointed pieces of Elder One architecture (floating blocks, shifting walls, sections of impossible angles) that coalesce temporarily to interact with or impede intruders. Not a solid entity but a mobile environmental hazard. May incorporate [[Shard of Impossible Geometry]] elements.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Does not 'attack' conventionally. Instead, rearranges the environment – sealing passages, creating pitfalls of warped space, attempting to crush intruders between shifting walls, or disassembling carried equipment by selectively unmaking geometry. Driven by the ruin's damaged environmental controls or residual geometric 'stress'.
*   **Habitat:** Actively shifting or unstable sections of [[Elder One Tunnel Network Entrance|Elder One ruins]].
*   **Dangers:** Can reshape the battlefield constantly. Indirect threat – causes crushing damage, traps victims, destroys gear. Cannot be 'killed' but might be temporarily dispersed by disrupting its focal point or stabilizing the local geometry. [[Psychic Resistance/Sensitivity]] might help anticipate shifts.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Demonstrates how Elder One architecture itself can be hostile, even unintentionally. Represents the breakdown of their reality-bending structures into dangerous, unstable forms.

### 27. Bio-Electric Eel (Weskhet-wa) (Serpent Sovereign Creation)

*   **(Type: Fish/Monstrosity, Serpent Sovereign Origin)**
*   **Appearance:** Large, eel-like creature adapted to murky waters. Skin may have metallic sheen or visible bio-capacitors along its flanks. Possesses oversized jaws and possibly vestigial limbs. Can generate powerful electrical discharges.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Uses electrical sense to navigate and hunt in low visibility. Shocks prey into submission before attacking with bite. Can unleash area-of-effect discharges affecting multiple targets in water. May coordinate attacks.
*   **Habitat:** Submerged [[Serpent Sovereigns]] ruins, deep sections of the [[The Great River Arat]] potentially contaminated by their technology, flooded caves.
*   **Dangers:** Powerful electrical attacks can stun, paralyze, or kill. Especially dangerous in water due to conductivity. May disable electronic (Precursor) equipment.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Another example of Serpent Sovereign bio-engineering, weaponizing natural electrical abilities. Their presence suggests active or residual Epoch 2 technology nearby, possibly related to power generation or defense.

### 28. Star-Weaver Null-Field Drone

*   **(Type: Construct/Anomaly, Star-Weaver Origin)**
*   **Appearance:** Small, floating drone, often spherical or disc-shaped, made of 'star-metal'. Emits a low hum and a visible field of energy distortion around itself. Moves silently and purposefully.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Projects an energy field that dampens or nullifies specific phenomena within its radius – could be magic, psychic abilities, specific energy frequencies, or even sound. Likely used for containment, security, or creating sterile work environments. Does not attack directly but its field is its function/weapon. Might follow intruders or patrol specific zones.
*   **Habitat:** Found in [[Star-Weavers]] research labs, containment facilities, or areas requiring specific environmental control.
*   **Dangers:** Nullification field can disable crucial abilities (magic, psychic skills, specific tech items) making users vulnerable to other threats or unable to proceed. Getting trapped within multiple overlapping fields could be disastrous. Destroying the drone might cause the field to collapse violently.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Shows a more subtle application of Star-Weaver technology focused on control and nullification rather than direct force. Hints at potential threats they needed to contain or phenomena they studied.

### 29. Chronomancer Echo Knight

*   **(Type: Undead/Construct/Anomaly?, Chronomancer Origin)**
*   **Appearance:** Resembles a Khemri warrior [[Warden's Bronze Scale Armor]] [[Bronze Khopesh]], but composed of flickering temporal energy or solidified [[Dust of Frozen Moments]]. Appears as an after-image or echo of a long-dead soldier, trapped in a loop of their final moments or bound to guard a location across time.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Patrols specific areas or re-enacts past battles. Attacks with weapons that inflict temporal wounds (causing rapid aging on impact, temporary displacement). May phase slightly, making it hard to hit, or exist slightly 'behind' the current time, reacting to attacks an instant before they land. Might be part of a larger 'temporal garrison'.
*   **Habitat:** Battlefields scarred by Chronomancer weapons, guarded vaults, areas caught in perpetual time loops related to conflict.
*   **Dangers:** Temporal attacks bypass conventional armor. Difficult to hit due to temporal displacement. May reform after being disrupted if the temporal loop persists. Destroying the loop's anchor or fulfilling the conditions of its existence might be required to defeat it permanently. [[Temporal Sense/Anomaly Navigation]] crucial.
*   **Significance/Lore:** A grim consequence of Chronomancer warfare or guardian creation – soldiers bound to fight forever as temporal echoes. Represents the lingering scars of their time-altering conflicts.

### 30. Scavenger Hyena (Shat)

*   **(Type: Mammal, Natural Fauna)**
*   **Appearance:** Dog-like carnivore with powerful jaws, sloping back, and coarse fur. Known for its distinctive 'laughing' calls. Travels in packs.
*   **Behavior/Abilities:** Primarily nocturnal scavenger but also capable hunter. Packs cooperate to bring down larger prey or drive predators off kills. Possess incredible bite force capable of crushing bone. Wary but can be bold when hungry or in large numbers.
*   **Habitat:** Deserts [[The Whispering Sands]], scrublands [[Scrubland]], outskirts of settlements, anywhere carrion or vulnerable prey might be found. Often dens in caves or abandoned structures.
*   **Dangers:** Dangerous in packs. Can inflict severe bites. Known to steal supplies or attack weakened travelers. Attracted to campsites by smell of food.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Seen by Khemri as unclean, cowardly, and associated with death and the wilderness. Sometimes linked to Set or chaotic forces. Their presence often indicates scarcity or recent death. Competitors with [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] for resources.

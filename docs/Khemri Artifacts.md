*   **Function (Known/Suspected):** A component capable of manipulating local gravity fields – increasing, decreasing, or nullifying gravity in a limited area. Likely part of larger systems for propulsion, construction, or defense. Might be usable as a tool if understood and powered. [[Engineering (Precursor Tech)]] vital.
*   **Dangers/Quirks:** Malfunctioning modulator could create crushing gravity fields or fling objects violently. Requires significant power. Uncontrolled activation is extremely dangerous. Interaction might require precise calibration.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Highlights the Star-Weavers' mastery over fundamental forces like gravity. Hints at how they built colossal structures or achieved flight/space travel. A potentially powerful but unstable piece of technology.

### 29. Chronomancer Paradox Engine Core (Depleted)

*   **(Type: Power Source?/Device Core, Chronomancer Origin)**
*   **Origin:** [[Chronomancers]] (Epoch 4). Found within the remnants of major temporal devices or power plants. Usually inert.
*   **Appearance:** A complex assembly of interlocking crystalline and metallic components that seem slightly out of phase or exhibit residual temporal shimmer. Often contains trace amounts of [[Dust of Frozen Moments]]. Feels temporally 'cold' or 'drained'.
  ![[Pasted image 20250420004537.png]]
*   **Function (Known/Suspected):** The central component of a device that powered significant temporal manipulations, possibly by harnessing controlled paradoxes or tapping into temporal energy sources. Now depleted, but might retain structural integrity or residual temporal charge. Recharging it is likely impossible or suicidally dangerous.
*   **Dangers/Quirks:** Even depleted, it might destabilize local time if disturbed significantly. Contains hazardous temporal residues. Studying its structure could offer insights but risks temporal contamination. Attempting to reactivate it would likely cause catastrophic temporal failure.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Represents the heart of the Chronomancers' most potent and dangerous technology. Even inert, it's a testament to their power and the inherent risks of manipulating time. Studying its design could be the ultimate goal for some scholars of the temporal arts.

### 30. Ceremonial Ostrich Feather Fan

*   **(Type: Regalia/Tool, Khemri Elite)**
*   **Origin:** Khemri artisans. Used by attendants for royalty or high priests.
*   **Appearance:** Large fan made from ostrich feathers attached to an ornate handle (wood, ivory, gilded). Used for cooling and as a symbol of status/presence.
*   **Function (Known):** Provides a cooling breeze. Symbolizes high status and divine presence (associated with air/breath). Used in royal courts and temple processions.
*   **Dangers/Quirks:** None, other than being cumbersome. A symbol that attracts attention.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Reflects the courtly life and religious ceremonies of Khemri elite. Associated with luxury, status, and the presence of important figures.

### 31. Kohl Pot and Applicator

*   **(Type: Cosmetic/Hygiene Tool, Khemri Common/Elite)**
*   **Origin:** Khemri artisans. Used by men and women.
*   **Appearance:** Small pot (clay, stone, faience) containing black kohl powder (galena-based). Often accompanied by a thin applicator stick (wood, bone, ivory). Pots can be simple or highly decorated. Referenced in [[game_concept.md]].
*   **Function (Known):** Used to apply black eyeliner (kohl). Believed to reduce sun glare, repel flies, and have protective magical properties against the 'evil eye'. Cosmetic and practical.
*   **Dangers/Quirks:** Kohl was often lead-based (galena), potentially causing long-term health issues (though Khemri were likely unaware).
*   **Significance/Lore:** Common item reflecting Khemri aesthetics, hygiene practices, and beliefs about protection and magic integrated into daily life.

### 32. Woven Reed Basket (Large)

*   **(Type: Container, Mundane Khemri)**
*   **Origin:** Khemri weavers (common craft). Ubiquitous.
*   **Appearance:** Large basket woven from reeds or palm fibers. Used for carrying grain, food, goods, or storing items. Can be simple or have dyed patterns.
*   **Function (Known):** General purpose carrying and storage. Essential for agriculture, trade, and daily household use.
*   **Dangers/Quirks:** Flammable, susceptible to rot/pests. Contents vary.
*   **Significance/Lore:** Fundamental object of Khemri material culture, reflecting their reliance on agriculture and basic craft techniques.

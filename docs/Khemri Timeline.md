# Khemri Timeline: Known History of the Khemri Dawn (Epoch 6)

*Note: Khemri chronology relies heavily on fragmented king lists, temple records, generational counts, and interpretations of celestial events. Dates become highly speculative further back in time, marked with '(?)'. All dates below are approximate relative points based on Khemri Scribe traditions and interpretations, subject to revision as new 'discoveries' are made.*

## I. The Mythic Founding & Early Settlements (Circa 2000-1500 Years Before Present Day - BP) - *The Time of Smoke and Whispers*

*   **~2000 BP? (The Sundering Legends / Emergence from Shadow):** Fragmented oral traditions and the oldest creation myths speak not of a beginning, but an *emergence*. Scattered tribes, depicted as refugees or survivors, stumble into the light of [[A'shar (The Sun-Father)]] from a period of profound darkness, chaos, or perhaps a 'dream-time'. Some tales involve guidance by animalistic spirits or luminous figures (potentially misremembered Precursors or their active technology). Key narratives focus on the discovery and sanctification of the [[The Great River Arat]] by figures embodying [[Nefet (The River-Mother)]], often portrayed as taming its wilder aspects or revealing its life-giving secrets. These legends likely represent the transition from nomadic survival in the aftermath of [[The Long Silence|Epoch 5]] to reliance on the river valley. Early encounters with incomprehensible Precursor ruins are likely woven into these myths as battles against 'earth demons' or discoveries of 'sacred ground' too powerful to disturb.
*   **~1850 BP? (The Reed Villages):** Archaeological evidence points to the establishment of numerous small, semi-permanent settlements along the most fertile river bends. These are characterized by simple reed shelters, basic pottery (often undecorated), flint tools, and evidence of early plant cultivation (native grains, flax) and fishing. Social structure appears tribal or clan-based, largely egalitarian. Burial practices are simple inhumations, often near the settlement edge. Early reverence sites, possibly natural rock formations or unusually large trees near the river, begin to show signs of offerings (smooth stones, carved wood fragments). Interaction with ruins is likely minimal, driven by fear and superstition.
*   **~1700 BP? (The Mudbrick Dawn & Rise of Chieftains):** Larger settlements emerge, incorporating sun-dried mudbrick structures alongside reed dwellings. Evidence of more organized agriculture, rudimentary irrigation channels dug by hand, and improved pottery with simple geometric decorations. Grave goods become slightly more common (beads, copper awls). This period sees the rise of influential 'Big Men' or chieftains, likely controlling larger family groups, more land, and potentially organizing labor for communal projects like ditch digging or constructing rudimentary defensive palisades. Copper smelting/working likely appears, initially for small tools and ornaments. Regional variations in pottery styles suggest distinct cultural groupings forming.

*   **~1600 BP? (Fortification & First Conflicts / Proto-States Emerge):** Settlements like proto-[[A'shar's Resplendence]] (perhaps called 'Sunstone Landing'?) and proto-[[City of the Serpent's Coil]] ('Rivermouth Watch'?) become significantly larger, some showing signs of defensive walls or ditches. Clearer social stratification appears in burials (some with more copper goods, finer pottery). Conflicts likely erupt over prime riverfront land, water access, and grazing rights, possibly driven by population growth or climatic shifts. Chieftains evolve into petty kings, commanding warriors armed with clubs, stone axes, and perhaps early copper-tipped spears. Early, localized pantheons develop, with solar deities gaining prominence in Upper Khemri (proto-A'shar's) and river/serpent deities in Lower Khemri (proto-Serpent's Coil), reflecting the key environmental factors. Metalworking advances slowly.

## II. The Age of Unification (Circa 1500-1000 BP) - *Forging the Kingdom*

*   **~1450 BP? (Dynastic Foundations & Bronze Age):** Powerful families consolidate control in the major centers, establishing hereditary rule. These early 'dynasts' claim divine favor, linking their lineage to protector spirits or early interpretations of the major gods. Bronze working becomes established, likely introduced through trade or independent discovery, leading to superior weapons ([[Bronze Dagger]], [[Short Spear (Bronze tip]]) and tools ([[Chisel (Bronze)]]). This technological edge fuels expansion and conquest. Written records may begin as simple tally marks or property symbols used by proto-[[Scribes]].
*   **~1300-1200 BP? (The Two Lands War):** A protracted period of intense conflict between the burgeoning kingdoms of Upper Khemri (Sun-focused, based at proto-A'shar's Resplendence) and Lower Khemri (River-focused, based at proto-City of the Serpent's Coil). Battles are fought along the river, involving infantry armed with bronze weapons and likely large fleets of war canoes or reed barges. Legends speak of mighty champions and devastating sieges. This era likely sees the formalization of military structures and the emergence of figures recognizable as early [[Wardens]]. The use of chariots might appear late in this period, dramatically changing warfare.
*   **~1150 BP? (Reign of Menkhar I - The Unifier):** A figure emerges from the chaos, Menkhar I, traditionally hailed as the first Sun-King of a united Khemri. Likely a powerful ruler from Upper Khemri who decisively defeated his Lower Khemri rivals. He establishes [[A'shar's Resplendence]] as the undisputed capital and likely initiates the grand ideological project of unifying the Khemri pantheon, elevating [[A'shar (The Sun-Father)]] to supreme status while incorporating [[Nefet (The River-Mother)]] and other regional deities into a structured hierarchy. He codifies the concept of the [[Sun-Kings|Sun-King]] as the divine guarantor of *Ma'at*.
*   **~1100-1050 BP (Consolidation & Monumental Beginnings):** Menkhar I and his immediate successors focus on consolidating power, establishing a centralized bureaucracy (staffed by early [[Scribes]]), standardizing weights and measures, and beginning the first truly monumental state-sponsored construction projects. This likely includes expanding [[A'shar's Resplendence]], building the first major temples dedicated to the unified pantheon (often deliberately built over or near significant Precursor ruins to claim their power or neutralize their influence), and possibly initiating the first royal tomb complexes beyond simple burials. Hieroglyphic script becomes more complex and widespread for administration and religious purposes.
*   **~1050-1000 BP (Securing the Borders):** Khemri military power, now unified and better equipped, pushes outwards. Campaigns are launched east into [[The Red Waste]] and west into [[The Whispering Sands]] to subdue hostile tribes ([[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] precursors) and secure trade routes or resource zones (quarries [[Limestone Quarry]], mines). Frontier fortresses like [[Dustfall Outpost]] are established, garrisoned by [[Wardens]]. [[Military Outpost (Border)]] mark the edges of Khemri's expanding influence. Contact and conflict with peoples beyond the immediate Khemri sphere likely begins.

## III. The Middle Kingdom Period (Circa 1000-400 BP) - *Apogee and Cracks*

*   **~950-750 BP (The Golden Age / Age of Monuments):** A long period of relative peace, stability, and economic prosperity under a succession of powerful Sun-Kings (e.g., Amenhotek the Great, Sesostris the Builder - names speculative). This era sees the construction of Khemri's most famous monuments: massive expansion of temple complexes like those at [[A'shar's Resplendence]] and potentially the precursors to [[Karnak Temple Complex (Exterior)]] and [[Luxor Temple (Exterior)]], vast networks of irrigation canals, and increasingly elaborate royal tombs in designated necropolises ([[Mastaba Field]] traditions evolve). Trade flourishes, bringing exotic goods and perhaps new ideas. [[Artisans & Craftspeople|Craftsmanship]] achieves remarkable skill levels. Population likely peaks. Bureaucracy becomes highly developed.
*   **~700 BP? (The Shadow of the Serpent / First Heresy):** Cracks begin to appear. Temple records mention King Akhensu II, who deviates from strict A'shar worship, showing unusual favor towards the cult of [[Nefet (The River-Mother)]]. This might coincide with unusual flooding patterns or discoveries made near the [[City of the Serpent's Coil]]. The [[Priesthood of A'shar]] likely resists this shift, leading to political tension and possibly localized violence. Akhensu II's reign is short and followed by successors who aggressively restore A'shar's primacy, potentially purging records of the 'heresy'. The [[Serpent Cultists]], however, likely use this period to solidify their underground networks and forbidden knowledge, perhaps incorporating misunderstood [[Serpent Sovereigns]] lore.
*   **~600 BP (Renewed Expansion & Overreach?):** Under vigorous Sun-Kings like Thutmose the Conqueror (speculative name), Khemri pushes its borders further, perhaps establishing temporary dominance over desert tribes or rival minor kingdoms. This period might see the construction of the most distant [[Military Outpost (Border)]]. However, this expansion stretches resources thin and potentially leads to encounters with more dangerous or inexplicable Precursor phenomena in previously unexplored regions.
*   **~550-450 BP (The Great Droughts & Time of Troubles):** A series of prolonged droughts and exceptionally poor inundations grips Khemri. Widespread famine occurs, leading to peasant uprisings, banditry ([[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] likely grow bolder), and a breakdown of central authority. Regional governors ([[High Nobility & High Priests]]) act with increasing autonomy, sometimes fighting amongst themselves. Trade collapses. The Sun-King's divine authority is questioned. This crisis forces Khemri society to look inwards. Some [[Scribes]] and priests might delve into ancient records or even cautiously explore ruins, seeking answers or forgotten knowledge [[Possible origins of groups like the [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]]]]. This period likely sees significant population decline and the abandonment of some settlements [[Abandoned Mudbrick Settlement]].

## IV. The Later Period & Reign of Aran IV (Circa 400 BP - Present Day) - *An Age of Unease*

*   **~400-300 BP (The Restoration Dynasty):** A new, vigorous dynasty (ancestors of [[Aran IV]]) emerges, possibly from a powerful noble family or military background. Through alliances and military campaigns, they gradually reunite the kingdom and restore central authority from [[A'shar's Resplendence]]. Focus shifts to rebuilding infrastructure (irrigation, granaries), re-establishing border security, and reinforcing traditional religious practices [[Theology/Ritualism]] to restore faith in *Ma'at*. Heavy taxes are likely imposed to fund reconstruction.
*   **~250 BP (The Silent Fear):** While stability returns, the 'Time of Troubles' leaves a scar. There's a documented increase in official pronouncements against disturbing ancient ruins and harsher penalties for tomb robbing [[Tomb Robber (Sekhem)]]. This might suggest that discoveries made during the decline were deemed deeply unsettling or dangerous by the restored authorities. The [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]] likely go deeper underground during this period.
*   **~100 BP? (The Whispering Plague / Dust Fever):** The mysterious plague strikes the [[Village of Lost Whispers]] in the [[Province of Whispering Sands]]. Official records blame 'bad air' or divine displeasure, but rumors persist of strange lights seen near the village beforehand or survivors speaking of maddening whispers [[Psychic Resistance/Sensitivity]]. The event reinforces the region's ominous reputation and the dangers associated with the [[The Whispering Sands]]. The area is likely quarantined by [[Wardens]], and access restricted, possibly hindering investigation into its true cause (natural vs [[Elder Ones]] vs [[Star-Weavers]]?).
*   **~60 BP (Accession of Aran IV):** [[Aran IV]] inherits the throne. Considered competent but perhaps uninspired compared to the founders of his dynasty. His reign focuses on maintaining the status quo achieved during the Restoration.
*   **~50 BP - Present (The Reign of Aran IV - The Present Day):** A period of surface stability but underlying tension. Aran IV balances the demands of powerful nobles and priests, manages resources carefully, and launches occasional construction projects (perhaps refurbishing existing temples rather than building new ones) or military parades to project strength. Key challenges intensify:
    *   **Border Pressure:** Increased raiding frequency from [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]], particularly near lucrative trade routes or vulnerable settlements like [[Khenet Oasis]]. Requires constant vigilance from [[Wardens]].
    *   **Factional Intrigue:** Subtle power struggles continue between the [[Priesthood of A'shar]] and hidden [[Serpent Cultists]]. The [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]] operate discreetly, possibly influencing events or sponsoring exploration (including the player's groups?) from the shadows. Noble families jockey for position.
    *   **Precursor Resurgence?:** Reports of strange events near ruins ([[Precursor Anomaly]]) seem more frequent or better documented. This could be due to increased exploration (driven by resource needs or factional curiosity), environmental shifts exposing new sites, or perhaps a genuine, subtle reawakening of dormant Precursor influences.
    *   **Recent Flashpoints:** The appointment of the pragmatic [[Warden Iymeru]] to the troublesome [[Dustfall Outpost]] region suggests ongoing issues there. The public disgrace of [[Scribe Vorin 'the Lesser']] hints at sensitive information being uncovered and suppressed. The rumors surrounding [[Serpent's Tooth]] and the [[Pouch with Shifting Seal]] point to potentially dangerous artifacts entering circulation. The overall atmosphere is one where the careful balance of Khemri society feels increasingly threatened by both internal pressures and the looming, poorly understood weight of the ancient past. This is the precarious world the player's explorers are stepping into.

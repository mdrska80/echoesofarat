---

## 1. The Royal Court & Bureaucracy

**(Type: Ruling Political Faction)**

*   **Leader:** [[Sun-Kings|Sun-King]] [[Aran IV]].
*   **Structure:** Hierarchical, centered on the Sun-King and his immediate family/advisors. Extends through various ministries (Vizier, Treasury, Granaries, Military Command - often overlapping with [[Wardens]] leadership) staffed by [[High Nobility & High Priests|high nobles]] and administered by numerous [[Lesser Nobility & Bureaucrats|lesser nobles]] and [[Scribes]]. Power is centralized but relies on regional governors (often nobles or high-ranking Wardens) to enact policy.
*   **Goals:** Maintain the stability and prosperity of the Khemri kingdom under the rule of the Sun-King; uphold [[Ma'at]] (cosmic/social order) as defined by A'shar worship; collect taxes/tribute; defend borders; manage resources (especially grain and river access); suppress dissent and heresy ([[The Serpent Heresy]]). Maintain the divine legitimacy of the Sun-King line.
*   **Key Figures:** [[Aran IV]] (Sun-King), Vizier (highest administrator), Royal Treasurer, High Steward, potentially influential royal family members or court favorites.
*   **Typical Locations:** [[A'shar's Resplendence]] (Royal Palace, administrative buildings), regional governor palaces, major granaries, royal construction sites.
*   **Allies:** Primarily the [[Priesthood of A'shar (The Sunlit Path)]] (symbiotic relationship), [[Wardens]] (enforcement arm). Relies on the loyalty (or compelled service) of the nobility.
*   **Enemies/Rivals:** [[Serpent Cultists]] (ideological/existential threat), [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] (threat to order/trade), potentially ambitious nobles, possibly [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]] (if their activities threaten stability or reveal inconvenient truths). Rivalry might exist with powerful temples like the [[Temple of Nefet at Per-Hapi]].
*   **Player Interaction:** Gaining audiences, seeking royal charters or permits, navigating court intrigue, fulfilling bureaucratic tasks (surveys, tax collection assistance), becoming entangled in succession disputes or noble rivalries, being hired for tasks benefiting the state. [[Faction Lore/Diplomacy]] and [[Negotiation]] skills important.

## 2. Priesthood of A'shar (The Sunlit Path)

**(Type: Dominant Religious Faction)**

*   **Leader:** High Priest of A'shar in [[A'shar's Resplendence]] (specific name TBD, potentially answers only to [[Aran IV]] or holds parallel power).
*   **Structure:** Rigid hierarchy descending from the High Priest. Includes various ranks of priests ([[High Nobility & High Priests|lector priests]], [[Wab]] priests, purification priests, mortuary priests [[Pasher (Priest)]]), priestesses, temple administrators, astronomers, healers, and temple artisans. Controls vast temple estates and resources. Strong presence in major cities, minimal in deep wilderness.
*   **Goals:** Maintain the supremacy of [[A'shar (The Sun-Father)]] worship; interpret divine will; perform daily rituals to ensure the sun's journey and cosmic order ([[Ma'at]]); advise the Sun-King; manage temple wealth and lands; educate [[Scribes]] and officials; counteract chaos ([[Isfet]]) and heresy ([[Serpent Cultists]], potentially unsanctioned worship of other gods like [[Ur-Ghul (The Star-Shepherd)]]). Preserve traditional knowledge (and suppress inconvenient knowledge).
*   **Key Figures:** High Priest of A'shar, heads of major temples, influential temple administrators, respected theologians or ritualists.
*   **Typical Locations:** Great Temple in [[A'shar's Resplendence]], other major temples dedicated to A'shar, temple workshops, libraries/archives (Per-Ankh), [[Festival Grounds of A'shar (Outside Capital)]].
*   **Allies:** [[The Royal Court & Bureaucracy]] (closely intertwined), [[Wardens]] (often protect temples/enforce religious law). Commands significant loyalty among the populace [[Rekhyt]].
*   **Enemies/Rivals:** [[Serpent Cultists]] (primary target of suppression), [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]] (seen as delving into forbidden/dangerous knowledge), potentially rival priesthoods ([[Temple of Nefet at Per-Hapi]], followers of Ur-Ghul), those who challenge their interpretation of Ma'at or historical dogma.
*   **Player Interaction:** Seeking blessings, healing, or divination; accessing temple archives (difficult); undertaking tasks for the temple (recovering stolen relics [[Priest's Incense Burner]], investigating heresy); navigating religious politics; potentially running afoul of temple law or dogma. [[Theology/Ritualism]] skill highly relevant.

## 3. The Wardens

**(Type: Military / Law Enforcement Faction)**

*   **Leader:** Nominally the [[Sun-Kings|Sun-King]] [[Aran IV]], but day-to-day command likely falls to a Warden General or regional commanders (like [[Warden Iymeru]]).
*   **Structure:** Military hierarchy with ranks (recruits, guards [[Bek (Guard)]], sergeants, captains, commanders). Organized into garrisons stationed in cities ([[A'shar's Resplendence]]), border forts ([[Khemri Border Fort (Bekhenet)]]), outposts ([[Dustfall Outpost]]), and patrols along major routes or sensitive areas. May include specialized units (border patrols, tomb guards, palace guard).
*   **Goals:** Enforce the Sun-King's laws; maintain order within Khemri lands; guard borders against external threats (nomads, [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]]); protect trade routes and strategic locations (quarries [[The Obsidian Quarries of K'thos' Fury]], mines [[Abandoned Copper Mine]]); suppress banditry and cult activity ([[Serpent Cultists]]); garrison key settlements and fortifications; act as the state's primary armed force. Potentially involved in monitoring/containing Precursor sites near settlements.
*   **Key Figures:** Warden General (highest field commander), regional commanders (e.g., [[Warden Iymeru]]), fortress commanders, captains of specific patrols or garrisons.
*   **Typical Locations:** Barracks in cities, [[Khemri Border Fort (Bekhenet)|border forts]], [[Dustfall Outpost|frontier outposts]], [[Warden Training Grounds (Akhet-Nefer)|training grounds]], guard posts along roads or at temple/palace entrances, patrols in the wilderness.
*   **Allies:** [[The Royal Court & Bureaucracy]] (receive orders and funding), [[Priesthood of A'shar (The Sunlit Path)]] (often cooperate on matters of law/order/heresy).
*   **Enemies/Rivals:** [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] (direct conflict), [[Serpent Cultists]] (targets for suppression), organized bandits, potentially rebellious nomads or provinces. Might have bureaucratic friction with local governors or priests. May view [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]] with suspicion.
*   **Player Interaction:** Being stopped/questioned by patrols, seeking aid against bandits, reporting crimes or cult activity, hiring Warden escorts (expensive/difficult), being conscripted or hired for specific military tasks, running afoul of military law, interacting with specific officers like [[Warden Iymeru]]. [[Combat]] and potentially [[Stealth]] or [[Negotiation]] skills relevant.

## 4. Seekers of the Veiled Path

**(Type: Secretive Scholarly / Explorer Faction)**

*   **Leader:** Unknown, possibly a council of elders or masters, or perhaps operates in decentralized cells. No single public figure.
*   **Structure:** Cellular and secretive. Small groups or individuals operate independently, reporting back to hidden leadership or archives. Hierarchy based on knowledge level and trustworthiness. Recruit cautiously, often targeting disillusioned [[Scribes]], curious scholars ([[Imani]]), or explorers who stumble upon Precursor secrets.
*   **Goals:** Uncover, understand, and preserve knowledge of the Precursor Civilizations ([[Elder Ones]], [[Serpent Sovereigns]], [[Star-Weavers]], [[Chronomancers]]). Believe this knowledge is vital for humanity's future or holds keys to transcendence/power. Oppose the destruction or suppression of Precursor artifacts and sites. May seek to cautiously reactivate certain Precursor technologies. Goals can range from pure knowledge acquisition to actively seeking power through ancient lore.
*   **Key Figures:** Likely known only by pseudonyms or titles within the organization. Master Archivist? Portal Navigator? Chrono-Scribe? [[Scribe Vorin 'the Lesser']] might be a disgraced former member or someone they watch closely.
*   **Typical Locations:** [[Seeker's Hidden Archive (The Silent Library)]], discreet safe houses in cities, temporary camps near active excavation sites (e.g., [[Mount Djew Peak & Star-Weaver Eyrie]], [[Elder One Tunnel Network Entrance]]), potentially using [[Seeker's Compass (Modified Khemri)|modified compasses]] to find sites.
*   **Allies:** Few overt allies. Might cautiously trade information or artifacts with specific [[Desert Nomads (Bedouin Clans)|nomad groups]] or independent explorers. May attempt to infiltrate [[The Royal Court & Bureaucracy]] or [[Priesthood of A'shar (The Sunlit Path)]] for information.
*   **Enemies/Rivals:** [[Priesthood of A'shar (The Sunlit Path)]] (views them as heretics dealing with dangerous powers), [[The Wardens]] (interfere with explorations, confiscate artifacts), [[Serpent Cultists]] (rivals in seeking forbidden power, often with conflicting methods/ideologies), [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] (destroy valuable sites/artifacts for scrap).
*   **Player Interaction:** Receiving cryptic clues or tasks; being hired to retrieve specific artifacts ([[Shard of Impossible Geometry]], [[Star-Weaver Diagnostic Tool]], [[Chronomancer Temporal Echo Recorder]]); gaining access to their knowledge base ([[Seeker's Hidden Archive (The Silent Library)]]); potentially joining the faction (risky); being targeted by them if the player possesses dangerous knowledge or artifacts they desire. Skills like [[Archaeology]], [[Linguistics/Epigraphy]], [[Engineering (Precursor Tech)]], [[Psychic Resistance/Sensitivity]], [[Temporal Sense/Anomaly Navigation]], and [[Faction Lore/Diplomacy]] are highly valued.

## 5. Serpent Cultists

**(Type: Forbidden Religious / Insurgent Faction)**

*   **Leader:** Varies by cell; often charismatic priests or priestesses claiming lineage or favor from serpent entities. May be a shadowy central figure ('The Serpent's Voice').
*   **Structure:** Secretive cells, often hidden within mainstream Khemri society or operating from remote locations ([[Serpent Cultist Sanctum (The Coil)]]). Hierarchy involves initiates, priests performing rituals, guards/enforcers, and potentially inner circles with deeper knowledge or mutations. Heavy use of secret signs and coded messages.
*   **Goals:** Resurrect the power and influence of ancient serpent entities (linked to [[Serpent Sovereigns]] or chaos gods like Apep); overthrow the rule of [[A'shar (The Sun-Father)]] and [[Aran IV]]; gain personal power through dark rituals, sacrifices, and potentially bio-augmentation ([[Serpent-Amphibian (Tekhen-nu)]]?); corrupt Khemri society from within. Believe the serpents offer true power or liberation from the 'tyranny' of Ma'at.
*   **Key Figures:** Cell leaders, high priests/priestesses of specific sanctuaries, potentially influential Khemri citizens secretly belonging to the cult.
*   **Typical Locations:** Hidden shrines or temples ([[Serpent Cultist Sanctum (The Coil)]]), basements/sewers beneath cities, remote swamps [[Papyrus Swamp]], possibly sections of [[The Sunken City of Yar'naath]]. Active recruitment might occur among the desperate or disillusioned.
*   **Allies:** Few true allies. Might temporarily cooperate with [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] or bandits for specific goals, but generally distrusted by all. Might seek to manipulate [[Possessed Khemri (Shemau-Isfet)]].
*   **Enemies/Rivals:** [[Priesthood of A'shar (The Sunlit Path)]] and [[The Royal Court & Bureaucracy]] / [[The Wardens]] (actively hunt them), [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]] (rivals for Precursor power, particularly [[Serpent Sovereigns]] related). Mainstream Khemri populace fears them.
*   **Player Interaction:** Being ambushed by cultists; discovering hidden shrines or sacrificial sites; investigating cult activity for the Wardens or Priesthood; being targeted for recruitment or sacrifice; finding texts or artifacts ([[Serpent Cultist Sacrificial Dagger]]) related to their practices; potentially infiltrating a cell (extremely dangerous). [[Combat]], [[Stealth]], [[Theology/Ritualism]], and [[Faction Lore/Diplomacy]] relevant.

## 6. Scavengers of the Red Waste

**(Type: Tribal Raider / Salvager Faction)**

*   **Leader:** Typically charismatic and ruthless warlords or 'Kings' leading individual tribes/bands (e.g., leader of [[Scavenger King's Fortress (Rust-Tooth Hold)]]). Leadership based on strength and success.
*   **Structure:** Tribal, often loosely organized around a strong leader. Composed of multiple bands or clans that may cooperate or compete. Little formal hierarchy below the leader, based on warrior prowess and loyalty. Includes warriors, crude artisans (modifying salvage), hunters, and often captives/slaves.
*   **Goals:** Survival in the harsh wastes; acquiring resources through raiding caravans, poorly defended settlements ([[Dustfall Outpost]]?), or Khemri work sites ([[The Obsidian Quarries of K'thos' Fury]], [[Abandoned Copper Mine]]); salvaging materials (especially metal) from Khemri or Precursor ruins to use or trade; defending territory against rivals and [[The Wardens]]. Value strength, cunning, and resilience.
*   **Key Figures:** Tribal Warlords/Kings, respected raiders or hunters within bands. [[Scavengers of the Red Waste Leader]] (generic link for now).
*   **Typical Locations:** Mobile camps in [[The Whispering Sands]], fortified bases in repurposed ruins ([[Scavenger King's Fortress (Rust-Tooth Hold)]]), edges of the [[Badlands]], fringe areas near Khemri settlements or trade routes, salvage sites like the [[Starfall Crater (Impact Site)]]. Also trade sometimes at the [[Nomad Market Hub (Whispering Bazaar)]].
*   **Allies:** Generally none; operate based on self-interest. Might form temporary alliances of convenience with other scavenger bands or bandits. Sometimes manipulated or hired by other factions (e.g., [[Serpent Cultists]]) for muscle.
*   **Enemies/Rivals:** [[The Wardens]] (primary antagonists), Khemri trade caravans/settlements (primary targets), [[Desert Nomads (Bedouin Clans)]] (often compete for resources like [[Khenet Oasis]]), rival scavenger tribes. View [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]] with suspicion or as potential sources of valuable salvage.
*   **Player Interaction:** Being attacked by raiding parties; negotiating passage through their territory (risky); trading salvaged goods (dangerous, might involve betrayal); freeing captives from their camps; attacking their strongholds for bounties or to retrieve stolen goods; potentially hiring specific bands for risky tasks (unreliable). [[Combat]], [[Survival]], [[Negotiation]], [[Stealth]] skills useful.

## 7. Desert Nomads (Bedouin Clans)

**(Type: Independent Cultural Faction)**

*   **Leader:** Clan Elders, respected Sheiks, wise women. Leadership based on lineage, wisdom, and tradition rather than brute force. Multiple independent clans exist.
*   **Structure:** Clan-based society, often centered around extended families. Governed by complex traditions, honor codes, and laws of hospitality. Decisions often made by councils of elders. Mobile lifestyle, following seasonal grazing, water sources, and trade routes. Skilled in desert survival and animal husbandry (camels, goats).
*   **Goals:** Preserve their traditional way of life; maintain independence from Khemri rule; protect clan members and territory (often defined by grazing rights and water sources like [[Khenet Oasis]]); trade goods like salt, hides, livestock, and desert knowledge; uphold clan honor and traditions. Generally seek balance with the harsh environment.
*   **Key Figures:** Clan Sheiks/Elders, renowned guides or storytellers, skilled hunters or craftspeople.
*   **Typical Locations:** Mobile tent encampments ([[Nomadic Encampment (Bedouin)]]) throughout [[The Whispering Sands]], traditional meeting points like [[Nomad Market Hub (Whispering Bazaar)]], specific oases ([[Khenet Oasis]]) or grazing areas used seasonally.
*   **Allies:** Other allied nomad clans. Might have cautious trade relationships with fringe Khemri settlements ([[Dustfall Outpost]]) or specific merchants. Sometimes possess unique knowledge valuable to [[Seekers of the Veiled Path]].
*   **Enemies/Rivals:** [[Scavengers of the Red Waste]] (often raid them or compete fiercely for resources), [[The Wardens]] (view them with suspicion, sometimes attempt to tax or control them), Khemri expansion encroaching on traditional lands. Rivalries exist between different nomad clans.
*   **Player Interaction:** Trading for unique goods or information (desert routes, location of ruins, creature lore); hiring experienced guides; seeking refuge or hospitality (requires respecting their customs); mediating inter-clan disputes; helping defend against Scavenger raids; potentially becoming honorary members or blood-sworn allies of a clan. [[Survival]], [[Negotiation]], [[Animal Handling/Taming]], and [[Faction Lore/Diplomacy]] are key.

## 8. Lesser Priesthoods/Cults

**(Type: Minority Religious Factions)**

*   **Leaders:** Respective high priests/priestesses of specific temples or cult centers (e.g., head priestess at [[Temple of Nefet at Per-Hapi]], [[Hermit's Cave of Ur-Ghul|hermit oracle]] of Ur-Ghul).
*   **Structure:** Variable. Some, like Nefet's priesthood, might have established hierarchies similar to A'shar's but smaller in scale. Others, like Ur-Ghul's cult, might be more decentralized, based around individual shrines [[Small Shrine (Local deity)]] or charismatic figures. Worship of gods like [[K'thos (The Desert Fury)]] might be very localized or propitiatory rather than organized.
*   **Goals:** Promote the worship of their specific deity; perform rituals relevant to their deity's domain (fertility, river management for [[Nefet (The River-Mother)]]; guidance, night, death for [[Ur-Ghul (The Star-Shepherd)]]; appeasement of destruction for [[K'thos (The Desert Fury)]]); maintain their temples/shrines; provide specific services to followers (blessings, healing, prophecy); protect sacred sites and knowledge related to their deity. Compete for influence and resources with other priesthoods, especially A'shar's.
*   **Key Figures:** High Priests/Priestesses of specific temples, influential oracles ([[The Oracle of Ur-Ghul's Cavern]]), respected elders within the cult.
*   **Typical Locations:** Temples dedicated to specific gods ([[Temple of Nefet at Per-Hapi]]), smaller local shrines, sacred natural sites (springs, specific mountains [[The Obsidian Quarries of K'thos' Fury]], caves), hermitages [[Hermit's Cave of Ur-Ghul]].
*   **Allies:** Primarily their own followers. Might form temporary alliances with other lesser cults against the dominance of A'shar's priesthood or cooperate with factions whose goals align temporarily (e.g., Nefet priests might cooperate with river merchants).
*   **Enemies/Rivals:** [[Priesthood of A'shar (The Sunlit Path)]] (often views them with suspicion or as lesser faiths, potentially heretical depending on practices), [[The Royal Court & Bureaucracy]] (if their influence challenges state authority), potentially [[Serpent Cultists]] (if their domains overlap or conflict ideologically).
*   **Player Interaction:** Seeking specialized blessings or services not offered by A'shar priests; gaining unique lore related to specific domains (river travel, night navigation, dealing with specific spirits); undertaking quests specific to the deity's portfolio (e.g., purifying a sacred spring for Nefet, retrieving a fallen star fragment for Ur-Ghul); potentially getting caught in conflicts between different priesthoods. [[Theology/Ritualism]] and [[Faction Lore/Diplomacy]] highly relevant.

Hi Gemini, let's resume work on the "Echoes of Khemri" project. Before proceeding or asking for clarification, please review the latest content and guidelines in these key files:
- `encounter_guidelines.md`
- `game_concept.md`
- `lore.md`

Remember to follow the defined file structure (placing new encounters in `Encounters/` and entities in `encounters-objects/`) and linking rules (`[[folder/filename]]`).

Continue from where we last left off, folder Encounters.

In case when it makes sense update also this prompt.
